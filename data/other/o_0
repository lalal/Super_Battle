Xavin notices the <a href=\"\/young-avengers\/4060-40426\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers<\/a> being attacked by Skrulls and manages to save <a href=\"\/hulkling\/4005-2259\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2259\">Hulkling<\/a> from capture. However, Hulkling is injured and both are cornered by Skrulls, who attack them in the sewer system.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><p> <\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a <a href=\"\/skrull\/4015-43139\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43139\">Skrull<\/a> Xavin is a natural shape shifter, and can alter her appearance at will. Because of the nature of her relationship with Karolina, Xavin generally takes the form of a black human female. She has also taken the form of a black human male (often when she wants to project a tougher image than what she believes her female form to be) and occasionally a more Skrull-like appearance.<\/p><p> <\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a Skrull, Xavin can shapeshift to an extent deeper than external appearance, able to rearrange anatomical and internal morphology. Xavin told <a href=\"\/mr-wilder\/4005-26252\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26252\">Mr. Wilder<\/a> that she didn't fear bullet injuries because she could simply move her internal organs out of the way.

Xavin states that she can only reliably control her powers if she uses them one at a time. She occasionally shows her lack of experience with the versatility of her abilities, such as trying to stretch from one building to another, rather than creating a relatively simpler force field bridge.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Gender Identity and Relationships<\/h2><p> <\/p><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5599\/151879-77483-xavin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-151879\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6975\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5599\/151879-77483-xavin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-151879\"><img alt=\"Xavin's struggle with identity\" src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5599\/151879-77483-xavin.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5599\/151879-77483-xavin.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/a><figcaption>Xavin's struggle with identity<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As a <a href=\"\/skrull\/4015-43139\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43139\">Skrull<\/a> Xavin is a natural shape shifter, and can alter her appearance at will. Because of the nature of her relationship with Karolina, Xavin generally takes the form of a black human female. She has also taken the form of a black human male (often when she wants to project a more intimidating image than what she believes her female form to be) and occasionally a more Skrull-like appearance. Xavin states that changing gender for a Skrull is a simple task, equivalent in meaning to changing one's hair color. Recently Xavin demonstrated that she reverts to her female human form when distressed and unfocused, pleasing Karolina who takes this to mean that Xavin's base gender is female. However, Xavin has secretly expressed some doubt as to whether she is male or female and whether she only changes into a female to please Karolina, who is distant when Xavin is in male form. The only Runaway member who asks Xavin about this is Molly. Molly also informs Xavin of Karolina's discomfort with her male form compared to her female form.<\/p><p>Because of Molly's statement, Xavin shapeshifts as Nico, a form that Karolina already likes, and approaches Karolina. Although Karolina can usually pick up Xavin's scent, Karolina is unaware of the shapeshft, Karolina thinks she is rejecting Nico. When Xavin reveals herself, Karolina reassures Xavin that she is happy being with Xavin as she is.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-104255\/","id":104255,"name":"Star-Crossed, Part

Eventually the Phoenix was able to trap Bete Noir inside of Earth, while the planet was still in the cooling process.<\/p><h3>Rook'shir<\/h3><p>One of the first, if not the first, recorded hosts of the Phoenix Force was Rook'shir of the Shi'Ar Empire. Despite only having the power for a few days, he razed an entire planet and had to be taken down by the first Imperial Guard (gathered solely to oppose him). After his death, a small fraction of the Phoenix Echo remained in his blade, dubbed the Phoenix Blade, and his ancestors were hunted down and killed since they were the only ones able to use the blade. Currently, Rook'shir's descendant Korvus wields the blade.<\/p><h3>Feron<\/h3><p>About 1,000 years ago the wizard Necrom, the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-148, and his two students Merlyn and Feroncame came to Earth-616 while on Necrom's journey for power. While deep in meditation, Feron came into contact with the Phoenix Force in visions of a fiery bird; these prompted the Phoenix to adopt the firebird form it has today. When the Phoenix came to Earth, Feron became its host and, using the Phoenix's power, aligned the mystical energy matrix of the multiverse and created a tower on each Earth (like Excalibur's former base). Necrom tried to seize the Force for himself but was only able to steal a small piece of it which he placed inside a corpse to incubate into the Anti-Phoenix. Feron dedicated the lineage of his family to waiting for the Anti-Phoenix to rise and inheriting the Phoenix Force when it did. The Phoenix disappeared into space for many years.<\/p><h2>Jean Grey<\/h2><p>The Force returned to Earth when it became aware of the young mutant Jean Grey. Jean was ten years old when her mutant power of telepathy first developed. Jean was out playing when her friend was struck by a car.

Returning from a mission on a space station, the X-Men had to return in a space shuttle through a solar radiation storm. Jean was the only that could fly the ship back home by reading the pilot's mind and encasing herself in a telekinetic shield. Her shield wasn't enough and Jean was dying of intense radiation poisoning.<\/p><h3>Phoenix I<\/h3><p>At this time, a cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force offered to save Jean. It took a small fragment of Jean's essence and created for itself a duplicate body with all of Jean's personality, assumed her place, and placed Jean in a recuperative cocoon at the bottom of the Jamaica Bay.<\/p><p>This new being actually believed itself to be Jean, and she rose from the bay as Jean Grey reborn with her powers increased and calling herself Phoenix. She rejoined the X-men and joined them on many adventures including a trip to the Shi'ar space where she used the power of the Phoenix to repair the energy lattice inside the M'Kraan Crystal.<\/p><h3>Dark Phoenix<\/h3><p>When the villain Mastermind, along with the Hellfire Club, psychically seduced Phoenix, the power became too much for the human portion it<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1541594\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10812\/1541594-198527_20478_jean_grey.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5425\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10812\/1541594-198527_20478_jean_grey.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1541594\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10812\/1541594-198527_20478_jean_grey.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10812\/1541594-198527_20478_jean_grey.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/a><\/figure><p>assumed and she became Dark Phoenix. Dark Phoenix flew into space and destroyed a solar system and a Shi'ar cruiser before returning to Earth to confront the X-men. After a psychic battle with Professor X, she was defeated and her power cut back to Marvel Girl levels by a new set of psychic circuit breakers placed by Xavier. She and the X-men are then transported to a nearby Shi'ar ship and she is about to be put to death by the Shi'ar council led by Xavier's lover Lilandra of the alien <a href=\"\/shiar\/4015-43138\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43138\">Shi'ar<\/a> Empire. When Professor X called for a duel in all their names, the X-Men fought for \"Jean's\" life. The human portion of Jean resurfaced in the Phoenix and committed suicide to prevent any injury to the X-Men as they fought for her.<\/p><p>Following this \"death\", the Phoenix regained its celestial form and memory. Horrified by what it had done, it attempted to atone by returning the stolen piece of lifeforce to Jean Grey in her cocoon. When Jean, in her stasis, realized what was done in her name, she rejected her tainted lifeforce, and this small fragment of Jean's essence and the Phoenix force found a home in the comatose body of Madelyne Pryor. So in the moments after the Phoenix's \"death\" on the moon, Madelyne sprang to life in Mr Sinister's Nebraska laboratory.<\/p><p>Some time later, the real Jean was discovered in her cocoon and Jean returned to the X-Men. Scott and Jean were married. There was some strain placed on their marriage through their lives as X-Men.<\/p><h2>Rachel Summers<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-174407\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4226\/174407-2562-marvel-girl.jpg\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"1.4221105527638\" data-width=\"199\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 199px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4226\/174407-2562-marvel-girl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-174407\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" data-width=\"199\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4226\/174407-2562-marvel-girl.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4226\/174407-2562-marvel-girl.jpg 199w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4226\/174407-2562-marvel-girl.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4226\/174407-2562-marvel-girl.jpg 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" data-width=\"199\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>While a small piece of the Force was taking up residence in Madelyne, the rest of the Force shortly after encountered Rachel Summers.

After being with the X-men for a short time, she found the holoempathic crystal from the Shi'ar imprinted with her mothers essence. While touching the crystal she tapped directly into the Phoenix Force and all its powers, claiming the name and costume of Phoenix for herself. After a somewhat unsuccessful run with the X-men, including botched encounters with the Beyonder, the Hellfire Club and Nimrod, Rachel was mortally injured by Wolverine and then spirited away to the Body Shoppe by Spiral. Her experiences while enslaved by Spiral are still unknown.<\/p><h3>Excalibur<\/h3><p>Months later, she resurfaced, first in the dreams of her former teammates and then in London, England pursuing Gatecrasher and her Technet as well as the Otherworldly Warwolves.

Eventually she discovered that by willing the Force dormant, her memory would gradually return. She let her memory heal for months until Necrom returned to claim the Anti-Phoenix and Rachel was forced to use the Phoenix's power to destroy him. This left her mind completely destroyed and the Phoenix took control of her body while she healed and flew off into space.<\/p><p>While in space, the Phoenix encountered Galactus while he was attempting to eat a planet. Trying to save a planet rather then destroy it as she had in the past, she tried to stop the World Eater. Eventually she noticed that as she used more and more of her powers she was affecting the very reality around her and nearly destroyed the planet she was so desperate to save. Once Rachel's mind had sufficiently healed, the Phoenix returned her to Earth but left her body, returning to its natural state once again, leaving Rachel's powers lessened (although still greatly enhanced from their natural state).<\/p><h2>Phoenix Resurrection<\/h2><p>Months later, while the Force was traveling through space, it was ripped from our universe into the Ultraverse by the sentient ship responsible for superhuman abilities in that world. It briefly inhabited the superhero Prime before moving to the pyrokinetic Amber Hunt. The sentient ship then took control of the Phoenix, using its power to replenish its own power cells. With the combined effort from the X-men and most of the heroes from the Ultraverse, the Phoenix was freed and sent back into space.<\/p><h2>Jean Again<\/h2><h3>Phoenix III<\/h3><p>Years later, Jean slowly began to take on the persona of Phoenix herself. First, by taking the name at Rachel's request before her death and then by wearing the green Phoenix costume and manifesting a firebird while using her own telekinetic powers. But it was while she was the headmistress of the Xavier Institute that it became clear she was directly tapping into the Force itself. In the meantime her husband, Scott, was having a telepathic affair with teammate and former villain Emma Frost (The White Queen). Upon discovering their infidelity, Jean nearly destroyed Emma's mind through telepathic torture and Scott ran off after a fight with Jean. When Emma Frost's diamond form was shattered, Jean used the Phoenix power to reassemble her at a molecular level.<\/p><h3>Planet X<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-175495\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/175495-198105-jean-grey.jpg\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/175495-198105-jean-grey.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175495\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/175495-198105-jean-grey.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/175495-198105-jean-grey.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/175495-198105-jean-grey.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/175495-198105-jean-grey.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>On a later mission, Jean and <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine<\/a> were trapped on a space station that was sent hurtling towards the sun.

These particular episodes are as close as the cartoon came to directly duplicating the comic book storylines \u2014 the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" is so accurate to the original stories that the episodes have the additional credit, \"Based on stories by Chris Claremont.\". Notably, however, as the Phoenix Force retcon had occurred before the creation of the series, the episodes were made with this change in mind \u2014 rather than having Jean develop her powers independently (as was the original intent of the comics), or be replaced by the cosmic Phoenix Force entity (as events were later retconned), the two concepts were merged, into Jean's actual body being <i>possessed<\/i> by the Phoenix Force, leading to a true struggle between two independent entities. Jean is shown piloting a shuttle, and when her telekenetic shield fails Phoenix enters her body. Rather than destroying an inhabited system \u2014 which was the cause for the decision to kill off the character in the comics \u2014 the animated story had her destroy a deserted system and only disable the attacking Shi'Ar cruiser. These changes made it possible for aspects of the original ending of <i>Uncanny X-Men<\/i> #137, in which Jean survives, to be used. Jean does still commit suicide (taking control of the Shi'Ar's laser beam to fire on herself, rather than finding an ancient weapon), but with her death, the Phoenix Force is purified, and then uses its powers to resurrect Jean, drawing on the combined life-force of the assembled X-Men to bring her back to life. Jean retained her original basic powers, whereas in the aborted comic book ending, she would have been lobotomized by the Shi'Ar and lost them entirely. She was voiced by Catherine Disher.<\/li><li>The Phoenix Force makes a cameo in the last episode of <i>X-Men: Evolution<\/i>. During a confrontation with Professor X, now a Horsemen of Apocalypse, the Phoenix briefly forms from the shield Jean made during their psychic battle. Following Apocalypse's defeat, her other cameo is part of Professor Xavier's glimpse of the future, and shows Jean Grey screaming out as she becomes the Phoenix.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The Phoenix makes an appearance in <i>Wolverine and the X-Men<\/i>. In this series, the Phoenix Force is an entity that has afflicted psychic mutants since the Homo Superior race first appeared. It enters the host at birth, growing with it. Once it reaches maturity, the Phoenix Force takes over its host, going on to cause mass destruction.It is revealed that it is Jean who causes the explosion as she transforms into The Phoenix and that the Hellfire Club is intent on taking the power from her for themselves. With the help of the Stepford Cuckoos, Emma Frost and the Hellfire Club take Jean away and makes the Stepford Cuckoos the host. Emma, Jean and Cyclops fight the Phoenix and Emma seemingly sacrifices herself to stop it. In this version, Jean Grey never wears the costume of the Phoenix Force. However, when the Stepford Cuckoos are in possessions of the force, they are revealed to wearing matching Dark Phoenix costumes. Whether the Phoenix created these outfits or the girls were already wearing them under their robes, is never explained.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Films<\/h3><ul><li>Famke Janssen plays Jean Grey in three movies, beginning with <i>X-Men<\/i>. During the film, Jean uses Cerebro for the first time, which causes strain on her mind and abilities. Later, she is affected by Magneto's machine which enhances the mutant gene in humans.<\/li><li>In the second film, <i>X2: X-Men United<\/i>, Jean Grey's powers have been evolving since the Liberty Island incident in the first movie. As Jean Grey uses her powers, a fiery aura appears in her eyes. In the climax of the movie, she is engulfed in a fiery aura as she holds back a tsunami of water from a burst dam to save the other X-Men. In the final scene, a giant flying fiery bird can be seen reflected in the water.<\/li><li>In the third X-Men movie, <i>X-Men: The Last Stand<\/i>, Jean \"becomes\" Phoenix. Jean is the only known class five mutant. At a young age, Xavier locked some of Jean's powers away as she could not control her near-infinite abilities. This causes a split in Jean's psyche\u2014between Jean Grey and the Phoenix (what her split-personality calls itself)\u2014and drives her to insanity. During the movie, Jean and the Phoenix battle for dominance. Jean tells Wolverine she thinks she killed Scott, although this is never confirmed. Phoenix destroys Xavier and joins Magneto. Jean\/Phoenix abstains from a battle on Alcatraz until the military reinforcements show up and try to shoot her; Phoenix then gains full control and in her fury demolishes the island, ripping it and everything on it apart on the molecular level. Wolverine climbs his way to Jean's side while his flesh is peeled from his Adamantium covered bones, his healing factor being the only thing keeping him alive. He calls to Jean, but there is only the Phoenix and it shows contempt for his actions. Logan tells Jean that he would only die for her and that he loves her. His heartfelt words pull Jean to the fore; she asks him to save her. He stabs her with his claws, killing her and ending the destruction. Jean's tombstone lies on the X-Mansion ground, beside the markers of Scott and Xavier.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Video Games<\/h3><ul><li>Jean Grey appears as \"Phoenix\" in the <i>X-Men: Mutant Academy<\/i> games for the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sony\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sony<\/a> PlayStation under the codename Phoenix and also as \"Dark Phoenix\" in <i>X-Men: Next Dimension<\/i>.<\/li><li>Jean Grey also appears as a playable character in <i>X-Men Legends<\/i>, and even wears the green and yellow\/gold phoenix costume in one or more of the levels.<\/li><li>In <i>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse<\/i>, Jean Grey, who is a playable character, has some attacks related to the Phoenix Force, such as the ability to resurrect another character during game play, and the player can also select for her both the original and Dark Phoenix costumes. In addition to Jean Grey, the PlayStation Portable version of this game also includes the Dark Phoenix separately as an unlockable bonus character. Her attacks are mainly related to the Phoenix Force itself, and is arguably the most powerful playable character in the game.<\/li><li>In <i>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance<\/i>, the Dark Phoenix made an appearance in the ending of the game if the player chooses to save Nightcrawler instead of saving Jean in Mephisto's realm. Since Jean Grey doesn't die in the Infinity Vortex, she will return to Earth in the form of the Dark Phoenix to take vengeance upon those who didn't save her.<\/li><li>In <i>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro<\/i>, a costume called Spider-Phoenix represents Spider-Man as host of the Phoenix Force, though Spider-Man can't use Phoenix's powers in game.<\/li><li>In <i>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2<\/i>, Jean Grey is playable, and has her Phoenix costume as her primary outfit. Two of her 4 power attacks take base from the Phoenix, resulting in fire mixing with telekinesis, and a massive fire blast.<\/li><li>Jean Grey appears as \"Phoenix\" as a playable character in the crossover fighting game <i>Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds<\/i>. She has the ability to resurrect herself as the Dark Phoenix.<\/li><\/ul>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-16618\/","id":16618,"name":"Greater Love Hath No X-Man","issue_number":"100"},"gender":0,"id":2164,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2363684-phoenixdone.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2363684-phoenixdone.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2363684-phoenixdone.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2363684-phoenixdone.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2363684-phoenixdone.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2363684-phoenixdone.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2363684-phoenixdone.jpg"},"name":"Phoenix Force","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-7\/","id":7,"name":"God\/Eternal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/phoenix-force\/4005-2164\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-2202\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":6,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:12","date_last_updated":"2012-04-02 08:04:11","deck":null,"description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-98104\/","id":98104,"name":"The Eternal Return, Part 1 of 12: Come the Revolution","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":2202,"image":null,"name":"Samson","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-708\/","id":708,"name":"Wildstorm"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/samson\/4005-2202\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-2228\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":3,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:25:56","date_last_updated":"2012-06-14 07:31:22","deck":null,"description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-103883\/","id":103883,"name":"Made In England Part 1","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":2228,"image":null,"name":"Colonel Nigh","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-10\/","id":10,"name":"DC Comics"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/colonel-nigh\/4005-2228\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-2237\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":3,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:00","date_last_updated":"2012-06-14 07:31:22","deck":null,"description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-103886\/","id":103886,"name":"Made In England Part 4","issue_number":"4"},"gender":0,"id":2237,"image":null,"name":"Tapper","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-10\/","id":10,"name":"DC Comics"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/tapper\/4005-2237\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-2239\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":2,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:21","date_last_updated":"2012-06-14 07:31:21","deck":null,"description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-103883\/","id":103883,"name":"Made In England Part 1","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":2239,"image":null,"name":"Filthy Sanchez","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-10\/","id":10,"name":"DC Comics"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/filthy-sanchez\/4005-2239\/"},{"aliases":"Pixi","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-2298\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":8,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:25:54","date_last_updated":"2016-05-15 07:10:03","deck":"This is The Evolved form of Clefairy, clefable uses it's sprouted wings on it's back to fly.","description":"<p>Clefable is a Moon Pokemon and the Final Stage of clefairy.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Height:\u00a04'03\"<br \/>Weight:\u00a088.2 lbs.<br \/>Number:\u00a036<br \/>Abilities:\u00a0Cute, Charm, Magic Guard<br \/>Evolution: Cleffa -&gt;
