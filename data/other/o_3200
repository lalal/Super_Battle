Though a popular urban myth contends that the Human Torch was replaced out of fear that children might have attempted to emulate him by setting themselves on fire, the reality was that the Human Torch was one of the characters that Marvel had licensed to Universal Studios for a solo film (which never materialized). Universal was unwilling to allow NBC to use the Human Torch in the show, so that a replacement was needed.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/88853\/2756763-fantastic4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2756763\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/88853\/2756763-fantastic4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2756763\"><img alt=\"1978 Fantastic Four Cartoon\" src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/88853\/2756763-fantastic4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/88853\/2756763-fantastic4.jpg 800w, http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/88853\/2756763-fantastic4.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-width=\"800\"><\/a><figcaption>1978 Fantastic Four Cartoon<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Needing a fourth member to round out the team, <a href=\"\/stan-lee\/4040-40467\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee<\/a> pitched the idea of a comedic robot sidekick.

Over the centuries, he battled Demonlords and witnessed worlds die. He practiced magic twelve hours a day to hone his skills, mastering the mystic arts relating to physics and essence. Ages had passed since his last opponent of note, though his past transgressions had amassed death threats from limitless foes. For Tenth, all the grand schemes and exploits of yesteryear had left him empty...until Lusiphur entered his life.<\/p> <p>In 1514, Tenth felt a drain from his vast stores of power, sensing that a younger elf had stolen a fraction of his power. In truth, the djinni Anhikiahl granted Luse a wish for super-speed by siphoning off of Tenth. To even the score, the High Wizard challenged Lusiphur to a contest. Granting them both the ability to transform into any creature, Luse had to travel to the end of Murderer's Pass without dying at Tenth's claws, talons, of fangs. If he survived, he would be free from Tenth's interference in his life forever. The High Wizard inadvertently doomed himself, as he carried Lusiphur (while assuming the form of a flea) across the finish line. Afterwards, the rogue elf gutted Tenth. The wizard teleported away, wounded yet excited by the thrill of defeat.<\/p> <h2>Sirius Comics: <\/h2> <p>\u00a0<br\/>An individual accustomed to time's passage, Tenth could accurately predict the behavior of most individuals- Lusiphur, however, remains a variable in existence, a spontaneous and fascinating break from the formula. Over the ensuing years, Tenth broke his promise, frequently manipulating events to test the young elf's mettle. He often targeted the women in Luse's life, and played a role in the death of his lover, Cassy. Tenth even romanced Lusiphur's ex-wife, the witch Hyena, though their union turned sour. After a violent break-up, Hyena placed a curse on the High Wizard. \u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-176984\/","id":176984,"name":null,"issue_number":"14"},"gender":0,"id":23732,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/1692648-tenth000002.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/1692648-tenth000002.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/1692648-tenth000002.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/1692648-tenth000002.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/1692648-tenth000002.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/1692648-tenth000002.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/1692648-tenth000002.jpg"},"name":"Tenth","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-595\/","id":595,"name":"Sirius Entertainment"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/tenth\/4005-23732\/"},{"aliases":"Naberius\nNaberus\nCerbere","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-23762\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":6,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:14","date_last_updated":"2013-03-11 13:15:10","deck":null,"description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-258814\/","id":258814,"name":"Vol. 2","issue_number":"2"},"gender":0,"id":23762,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2921649-nebirossmt.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2921649-nebirossmt.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2921649-nebirossmt.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2921649-nebirossmt.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2921649-nebirossmt.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2921649-nebirossmt.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2921649-nebirossmt.jpg"},"name":"Nebiros","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-9\/","id":9,"name":"Other"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-2526\/","id":2526,"name":"In the Public Domain"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/nebiros\/4005-23762\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-23792\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":6,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:01","date_last_updated":"2013-06-07 15:07:32","deck":"North american mythical creature.","description":"<p>A rabbit with antlers.
