Legion, in an effort to find Shepherd, traveled to numerous sites the commander visited during the his investigation of the rogue Spectre <a href=\"\/saren-arterius\/4005-83119\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83119\">Saren Arterius<\/a>.<\/p><p>Legion visited Eden Prime, Therum, Feros, Noveria, Virmire, Illos, and several uncharted worlds before finding the original Normandy's crash site on Alchera. While on Eden Prime, Legion was attacked by Alliance soldiers and sustained a rifle shot to his chest.<\/p><p>This left a large hole which he patched with N7 Armor from the crash site on Alchera. This armor was Shepherd's own armor and when questioned why he didn't patch it sooner Legion responds with \"no data available\" implying the decision was irrational and not usual of the Geth, further showing off its uniqueness.<\/p><h2>Mass Effect 2<\/h2><h3>The Derelict Reaper<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100757\/2260315-legion3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2260315\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100757\/2260315-legion3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2260315\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/10\/100757\/2260315-legion3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100757\/2260315-legion3.jpg 1920w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/10\/100757\/2260315-legion3.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/100757\/2260315-legion3.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Legion is first encountered by Shepherd and the crew of the <a href=\"\/normandy-sr-2\/4055-57122\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57122\">Normandy SR-2<\/a> on board a derelict Reaper orbiting Mnemosyne, a brown dwarf. Shepherd was there to find an IFF device in order to penetrate the Omega 4 Relay and Legion was there in order to gain further information on the Reapers. Legion was surprised to see Commander Shepherd alive and saved the group from a husk ambush. Legion was the first Geth to speak to Shepherd.<\/p><p>When Shepherd arrived at the Mass Effect Generator core Legion was already working on the console but was attacked and deactivated by a husk. Shepherd and the crew destroy the core and take Legion's deactivated mobile platform aboard the Normandy for study since Legion was not acting like the Geth Shepherd had seen before.

Legion shows no hostility towards Shepherd and requests to join his team in fighting the Collectors and Reapers. Legion does not have its name yet and when Shepherd asks he simply says Geth. EDI quotes the Bible Gospel of Mark 5:9 <em>\"We are Legion for we are many.\"<\/em> This is suited as an \"appropriate metaphor\" and Legion gets its name.<\/p><p>When speaking to Legion it will either answer with a very straight forward one word answer or if sentences are needed they will be highly organized thoughts. Legion will speak about the Geth heretics and how the Reaper, Sovereign, swayed them to his side. Legion will discuss topics about its own Geth and the \"Morning War\". Legion will playback the first recording of a Geth asking if he had a soul which frightened the <a href=\"\/quarian\/4060-59004\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59004\">Quarians <\/a>into trying to exterminate the Geth. Legion's last conversation details how the Geth are constructing a massive station with the closest human analog being a Dyson Sphere so all Geth programs can be uploaded and never be alone again.<\/p><h3>A House Divided<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100757\/2260313-legion_05_by_johntesh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2260313\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100757\/2260313-legion_05_by_johntesh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2260313\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/10\/100757\/2260313-legion_05_by_johntesh.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100757\/2260313-legion_05_by_johntesh.jpg 1920w, http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/10\/100757\/2260313-legion_05_by_johntesh.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/100757\/2260313-legion_05_by_johntesh.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Legion will go to Shepherd with an urgent request concerning the Geth heretics. The heretics had developed a Reaper based virus in order to corrupt Geth and turn them into followers of the Reapers. Legion explains that the virus causes errors in their most basic run times and changes all higher thought processes.<\/p><p>The virus is housed in a space station between stars because organics have no reason to look there. Legion needs the stealth system of the Normandy in order to get close to the station. The Normandy's stealth drive is particularly effective on Geth craft since Geth do not use windows, considering them a structural weaknesses.<\/p><p>Shepherd and Legion infiltrate the Geth Station and Legion brings up the point that since the virus is complete Legion could re-purpose it to brainwash the heretics back into the Geth. Since this is new data Legion takes the mission to process and reach a consensus.<\/p><p>During the mission Legion finds evidence that the heretics have run times in the Geth networks and are spying on them. This confuses Legion as the heretics were allowed to leave and the nature of Geth is to share all data and knowledge. It does not make sense why the heretics would spy on the true Geth. Once in the Central Station chamber Legion poses the question of whether to rewrite the heretics or blow the station to Shepherd. Legion is split between the issue with 573 programs favor rewriting and 571 favor deletion.<\/p><p>Legion says Shepherd has perspective the Geth lack since he has fought the heretics. Shepherd not wanting to kill the Geth has them rewritten and the team evacuates before a large EMP of 1.21 petawats fires through the station and travels through FTL channels.<\/p><h3>The Collector Base and Beyond<\/h3><p>Legion traveled with Shepherd and the rest of the crew to the Collector base and assaulted it alongside the rest of the Normandy crew. After Shepherd was asked to return to Alliance space to answer for the death of 300,000 Batarian colonists, Legion left to return to the Perseus Veil and report to the Geth consensus. The Geth then began to prepare for war with the Reapers while finishing construction of their Dyson Sphere like housing.<\/p><p>While construction was nearly complete the Quarian fleet began a war to retake Rannoch and bombed the structure, not knowing what it truly was. This caused the death of a large number of Geth programs. Since Geth network to gain intelligence, this greatly narrowed the Geth's perspective and survival became a priority. The Geth accepted an offer from the Reapers. The Reapers uploaded their own code to increase the intelligence of the Geth and their fighting ability while the Reapers maintained control of the Geth.<\/p><p>The Reapers played the signal through a Geth Dreadnought of considerable size. Legion was against this decision but was used as a booster for the signal and placed inside a machine on the dreadnought. The Geth fleet could now fight off the Quarian assault and had them trapped inside the system as they covered the Mass Relay.<\/p><h2>Mass Effect 3<\/h2><p>Commander Shepherd first re-encounters Legion when the Normandy's crew infiltrates the Geth Dreadnought and frees it from the Reaper machine. Though some newer squad members will express negative feelings over Shepherd knowing a Geth by name they free him and Legion disables the Dreadnought's weapons, shields, and kinetic barriers. The mission was to disable the Dreadnought so the Quarian fleet could flee and join the war effort.<\/p><p>Admiral Han'Gerrel vas Neema instead has the Quarian Heavy Fleet bombard the Dreadnought in order to destroy it, almost killing Legion and Shepherd who use a Geth fighter to escape. This ruins the Quarians' chance at retreat. Legion then accompanies Shepherd aboard the Normandy where it meets Admiral Raan who is distressed at the sight of the Geth and Admiral Xen who wants to dissect Legion. Legion will show the Admirals and Shepherd how the Reaper code has upgraded the Geth and that Geth units can now be considered alive.<\/p><p>The Geth themselves find this \"Beautiful.\" Legion will also state that while he is no longer broadcasting the Reaper signal there is a short range signal coming from Rannoch itself. Legion spends his time in the Normandy's War Room trying to locate the Reaper base where the signal is broadcast.<\/p><p>Legion will reveal a Geth Fighter Squadron hub to Shepherd and the Admirals. Saying its destruction would help the Quarian liveships survive the battle. The Admirals approve of the destruction of the server hub and Legion accompanies Shepherd on this mission.<\/p><p>During the shuttle ride down, Legion reveals the mission involves Shepherd actually going inside the Geth consensus virtually through an interface adapted from Cerberus' Project Overlord. Inside the Geth consensus, Shepherd sees important events in Geth history, such as the first Geth to come online and receive the Geth name, the Geth first proposing the question of his soul, the first Geth to pick up a weapon, Quarian sympathizers protecting Geth from Quarian police, the Geth allowing the Quarians to leave Rannoch, and Shepherd agreeing to work with the Geth.<\/p><p>When Shepherd asks why the last one is important, Legion reveals that Shepherd was the first organic to cooperate with the Geth since the \"Morning War\" 300 years ago and that the Geth did not want to forget it. Once Shepherd takes the hub offline, the Geth Fighters stop attacking Quarian liveships and Legion reveals there was a secondary purpose to the mission. Legion was able to convince Geth programs to join its cause and upload into powerful Geth Prime mobile platforms. These Prime are sent to Admrial Hackett of the Alliance for support.<\/p><p>Legion is able to locate the Reaper base and accompanies Shepherd on the mission. Shepherd takes a targeting laser to pinpoint a vital area the Normandy can hit. During the shuttle ride, Legion reveals he has some of the Reaper code inside himself so he can counteract any defensive measure the Reapers have put in place. Legion displays a level of shame over this, though he realizes the benefits. Legion separates from Shepherd's team to disable defenses and acquire an escape vehicle. Throughout the mission, Legion disables base defenses and guides Shepherd to an area where he can paint the target.<\/p><p>Once Shepherd has the Normandy strike the base, it is revealed the signal is coming from an actual Reaper. Legion drives a Geth land vehicle while Shepherd mans the guns, firing at the Reaper. Shepherd will use the targeting laser linked to the Quarian Heavy Fleet to destroy the Reaper. Once done, the Quarians begin attacking the disabled Geth ships and Legion proposes using the Reaper code to upgrade all Geth into true AI's. Tali'Zorah will adamantly vote against this as the Geth will fight back and destroy her people. Shepherd allows Legion to upload the code while he and Tali convince the Quarian fleet to stand down. This allows both fleets to survive. Legion at 80% upload will note that it is not enough and upload its own personality to complete the transfer.<\/p><p>In Legion's last moments it refers to itself as \"I\" instead of \"we\" showing that it has become an individual instead of an avatar of the Geth consensus. Legion \"dies\" on Rannoch saving the Geth and giving them their intelligence. A Geth prime then approaches Shepherd, Tali, and Admiral Raan and says the Quarians are welcome to return to Rannoch and the Geth will honor both Legion and its promise to help Shepherd retake Earth from the Reapers.<\/p><h2>Abilities<\/h2><p>Legion is a gestalt intelligence and an avatar of the Geth Consensus. Legion is a combination of 1,183 Geth programs loaded onto a unique mobile platform. Legion as a squad mate is a tech type character who can release drones to aid in battle while wielding an assault rifle and sniper rifle.<\/p><p>Legion is shown very proficient with the sniper rifle as his machine reflexes are much faster than those of an organic. Legion is very durable, being able to survive an Alliance rifle shot that ripped a clear hole in his chest and still continue as if nothing happened with only basic patchwork.<\/p><h2>Other Outcomes<\/h2><h4>Mass Effect 2<\/h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2997226\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4787430683919\" data-width=\"541\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 541px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2997226\"><img alt=\"Cerberus Legion Assassin.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png 541w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png 480w, http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cerberus Legion Assassin.\" src=\"http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png 541w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png 480w, http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/103617\/2997226-legion_assassin.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Cerberus Legion Assassin.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Legion can have several fates in the game.

This allowed the Seven Deadly Sins to terrorise the planet and thus marked Pandora as one of the Trinity of Sin by the Circle of Eternity. At some point, the Sins were all imprisoned within human bodies until the modern age. During that time, the recently freed Black Adam sought out Sloth and returned him to his true nature. Afterwards, Black Adam freed the other remaining Sins and gained their loyalty as they feared his power to trap them once again. Thus, they worked with Black Adam to find the heir of the Wizard who prior to dying gave his magical power to a boy called Billy Batson. Whilst Black Adam searched for Batson, the Seven Enemies of Man took possession of a human host and became a giant fiery demon that attacked the city until Teth-Adam's defeat.

Such clever use of suggestion in the comic strip ensures that it is never gory, and rarely graphic, even though some of Bunny's deaths are horrendously violent.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-353835\/","id":353835,"name":null,"issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":85342,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2553703-bunny.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2553703-bunny.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2553703-bunny.png","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2553703-bunny.png","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2553703-bunny.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2553703-bunny.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2553703-bunny.png"},"name":"A Bunny","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-8\/","id":8,"name":"Animal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-3608\/","id":3608,"name":"Hodder & Stoughton Ltd"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/a-bunny\/4005-85342\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-85343\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":3,"date_added":"2012-08-26 14:20:02","date_last_updated":"2013-02-04 17:53:11","deck":"One member on Captain Castle's platoon.

By the end of the trilogy Shepard has attained a legendary status as one of the finest soldiers in the Galaxy.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>Due to the nature of the series, Commander Shepard can be either male or female (named by the default settings as either \"John\" or \"Jane\"), and can have varying histories such as being Earth-born, a \"Spacer\" or Colony born. The default Shepard is male, (although this default is only applicable in Mass Effect 1) Earth-born and the sole-survivor of a devastating battle.<\/p><p>Despite the customizable options, several facts remain true across all \"Shepards\"; he\/she was born on April 11th 2154 and is a graduate of the N7 System Alliance Special Forces Program. Shepard was assigned to the SSV Normandy as an Executive Officer after graduation. During the events of Mass Effect 1, Shepard became the first human Spectre; an elite force that work on the behalf of the Citadel Council.<\/p><h2>History<\/h2><p>As aforementioned, Shepard's pre-service history can alternate greatly. The Spacer background involves the fact that both of Shepard's parents were in the Alliance military, as a result of this, Shepard's early childhood involved traveling from outpost to outpost, cluster to cluster. Never staying in one place for more than a couple of months. Shepard followed in the footsteps of his\/her parents and joined the Alliance military at the age of eighteen.<\/p><p>The Colonist background involves Shepard being born, and growing up, on the Planet Mindoir, which was a small human colony located in the Attican Traverse (itself located near the Terminus System). The Atticus Traverse was the \"frontier\" of Citadel-controlled Space, beyond it's borders lay the systems populated by the relatively minor non-citadel species, which are generally regarded as being less-civilized as those species represented by the Council.<\/p><p>At the age of sixteen, Batarian slavers raided Mindoir and killed Shepard's closest family and friends. During the massacre, Shepard managed to evade capture until a passing Alliance patrol responded to the rescue plea and rescued Shepard. Two years later, Shepard signed up the Alliance Military. Finally, the Earth-born history dictates that Shepard was raised as an orphan, and drafted into a life of petty crime and underworld dealings. At the age of 18, wanting to escape this life, Shepard enlisted with the Alliance Military.<\/p><p>Following on from the early life history, it is possible that Shepard's psychological profile, as based on key events in his\/her service record, can differ between three possible choices of Sole-Survivor, War Hero and Ruthless. The Sole-Survivor profile states that during Shepard's service, a relatively simple mission resulted in the rest of his\/her unit being decimated in a Thresher Maw attack on the barren planet Akuze. Forced to survive in this hellish environment for weeks before rescue, Shepard underwent immense physical and psychological stress. The War-Hero history states that early in Shepard's military career he\/she repelled a Batarian slavers invasion on the planet Elysium single-handedly.<\/p><p>Shepard risked his\/her life to save many. As an award for Shepard's bravery, the Alliance awarded numerous decorations upon the would-be Commander, a feat that would be repeated time again over his\/her military career. The Ruthless history states that Shepard has always adhered to one rule; get the job done, no matter what it takes. Shepard has gained a ruthless reputation, and a certain wariness regarding his\/her soldiers, not least because of the battle which took place on Torfan; in which Shepard sent over three quarters of his\/her squad to their deaths as well as brutally murdering the attacking Batarians.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>The character of Commander Shepard was created by Game Developers Bioware as the main protagonist (and only playable character) to their game Mass Effect, which was released in 2007. Originally an Xbox 360 exclusive, Mass Effect was later ported onto the PC format (in September of 2008) and the Playstation 3 format (December 4th 2012).<\/p><p>Commander Shepard's story is the main focus of the Mass Effect franchise, continuing on in 2010's Mass Effect 2, and concluding in Mass Effect 3 which was released on March 9th 2012. Shepard was named after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American to fly into space.<\/p><h2>Mass Effect<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2782029\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/123851\/2782029-200px_mass_effect_original_poster.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.465\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/123851\/2782029-200px_mass_effect_original_poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2782029\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/123851\/2782029-200px_mass_effect_original_poster.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/123851\/2782029-200px_mass_effect_original_poster.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/a><\/figure><p>The first game released in the trilogy introduced the character of Shepard, then a decorated Commander regardless of the choices made by the player in the customization system. The game is set in the year 2183, 35 years after humans discovered abandoned Prothean technology on Mars, and some years after the discovery of the Mass Effect relays which allowed faster-than-light travel to be possible to the human race.The Mass Effect relay which existed in the Sol system (home to Earth) was only a small part of a much greater network which connected numerous systems in the Milky Way Galaxy.<\/p><p>At the beginning of the game, Commander Shepard is on board the SSV Normandy, en route to a relatively simple, supposedly low-risk mission to recover the recently unearthed Prothean beacon on Eden Prime. The mission was initially supposed to test Shepard's candidacy for the Elite Special Forces Program titled Spectre, and was being observed by current Spectre, and member of the Turian race, Nihlus Kryik. However, upon arrival it became evident that an unknown alien force was attacking the colony of Eden Prime, and the routine retrieval mission became one of rescue.<\/p><p>Upon searching the immediate area, it is clear that <a href=\"\/geth\/4060-59005\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59005\">Geth<\/a> forces are attacking, led by the rogue Spectre <a href=\"\/saren-arterius\/4005-83119\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83119\">Saren Arterius<\/a>. Nihlus confronts Saren, but is killed brutally. After finding the Prothean Beacon, Shepard approached it, only for the beacon to become active and exposing Shepard to ancient knowledge and visions directly into his\/her mind. The beacon then deactivates, seemingly destroyed. After the mission, Shepard and the Normandy arrive at the Citadel, and confront the Council with the knowledge that one of their forces as become a rogue.<\/p><p>After the initial dismissal of Shepard's declaration, the Commander goes in search of evidence that would prove that Saren is a rogue operative. Confronted with the evidence, the Council instate Shepard as a Spectre, and give him\/her a mission; stop Saren.<\/p><h2>Mass Effect 2<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3199737\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199737-250px-masseffect2_cover.png\" data-ratio=\"1.444\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199737-250px-masseffect2_cover.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3199737\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199737-250px-masseffect2_cover.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199737-250px-masseffect2_cover.png 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/a><\/figure><p>In Mass Effect 2, Shepard reprises his\/her main character status.

However, if the player has no save to import or chooses not to import, players are allowed to create Shepard with the same depth (class, psych-profile, appearance) that they could in Mass Effect. However, the events of the previous game are decided by Bioware (with the exception of the Alliance council representative), with many references to side quests in the first game not available.<\/p><p>Much of the game focuses on Shepard's relationship with his\/her new crew members and the Illusive Man. Shepard's ultimate aim is to take on the Collectors in a suicide mission. And unless the players make the right choices during gameplay, the commander can end up dead as a result.Mass Effect 3<\/p><p>Commander Shepard is once again the protagonist in Mass Effect 3. Though it is possible for a Mass Effect 2 to end in such a way that all of the player's characters including Shepard die, such save files are not eligible for upload into Mass Effect 3. The game also features a new iteration of the 'default' female Commander Shepard, in the form of a character whose design was voted on by the community.

Decisions that the player made in the first two games affect specifics of certain events that take place in Mass Effect 3. However, regardless of these specifics, Shepard's main goal is to defeat the Reapers through the activation of a device known as the Crucible. Shepard has four ways to end the war:<\/p><p>Destroy the Reapers: In this ending, Shepard shoots a key control panel, causing a massive explosion. Using the mass relays, the energy fired by the Crucible travels from relay to relay, causing all synthetics to be destroyed across the galaxy, including the Reapers, EDI and the Geth. The mass relays and the Citadel are badly damaged but eventually repaired. If the player's Effective Military Strength is high enough, Shepard is shown to have survived, taking a deep breath in a pile of rubble. Otherwise, Shepard is killed.<\/p><p>Control the Reapers: Shepard takes control of the Reapers, becoming the new Reaper master consciousness. The Reapers depart Earth in this scenario and the Citadel survives and the Reapers help rebuild the galaxy, including the mass relays. If Shepard is a Paragon, the Commander will \"give the many hope for the future\". If Shepard is a Renegade, the Commander will \"provide the many with a powerful leader\".<\/p><p>Synthesis: In this ending, Shepard jumps into the Crucible's energy beam, sacrificing his\/her life. Shepard's sacrifice transforms all life in the galaxy into a new form of synthetic-organic life. The Reapers depart Earth and the mass relays and Citadel are damaged by the Crucible firing. The Reapers help rebuild the galaxy, including the mass relays, and share the knowledge of the civilizations they have harvested in the past.<\/p><p>Refusal: In this ending, Shepard refuses to choose any of the three possible options. The Catalyst acknowledges the Commander's decision and disappears leaving the Crucible unable to fire. The Reapers succeed in harvesting all organic life throughout the galaxy as well allowing the cycle to continue.<\/p><p>Many years into the future, Shepard has become a legendary figure known as \"The Shepard\".Quotes<\/p><p>Shepard often ends conversations with \"I should go\". It's said to such an extreme that Female Shepard's voice actor, Jennifer Hale jokingly said \"If I had a nickel for every time I had to say 'I should go', I wouldn't have to work anymore. I should go.\"<\/p><h2>Personality<\/h2><p>Shepard's personality differs wildly depending on the decisions he\/she takes. The morality\/personality paths come in three varieties Paragon, Renegade, or a mixture of both. The Paragon Shepard is an incorruptible pillar of goodwill, kindness, compassion, and strength. Though constantly making hard decisions, the Paragon Shepard will try his\/her best to solve a problem with the least amount of death and conflict. Whether it is rational to try or not. The Renegade Shepard is an anti-hero with one foot in villain territory.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3199841\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199841-shepard.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.71058823529412\" data-width=\"425\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 425px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199841-shepard.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3199841\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199841-shepard.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199841-shepard.jpg 425w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199841-shepard.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199841-shepard.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Though both versions of Shepard will solve a problem through any means necessary, The Renegade Shepard will attempt to solve the problems through the most sporadic or confrontational solutions. He\/she will shoot first and ask questions later. He\/She will sometimes shoot even, when there's another equally viable non-violent solution. The \"Mixed\" Shepard plays each situation by ear. Sometimes he\/she works hard to keep everyone alive and sometimes he\/she just doesn't care and wants to complete the mission. Regardless of the morality path chosen each Shepard personality share some basic concepts.<\/p><p>Above all else, Determination. Shepard, regardless of the perils of imminent death and all personal endangerment, Shepard will not quit, even when the entire universe is in peril, and the universe is getting destroyed around him\/her, and the universe begins to weigh on him\/her, Shepard never quits. Also Shepard is always a great leader, Shepard is capable of encouraging and inspiring people by his\/her mere presence. Miranda Lawson draws attention to this, claiming that Shepard has \"that fire that makes someone willing to follow you into hell itself.\" Regardless each Shepard is witty and snarky and risky.<\/p><h2>Gender<\/h2><p>Commander Shepard's gender could be either male or female, it was apparently not recorded by history. In game though, the only thing that gender changes is the romance options. Commander Shepard's doesn't become any less of a badass, nor does his\/her competency change, whether male or female. There's only an appearance change and romance options change.<\/p><h2>Romance<\/h2><p>Like every other aspect of the character, Commander Shepard has a multitude of romance choices in each game. In the latest iteration Mass Effect 3, Shepard has options of heterosexual and homosexual options as well as a variety of different alien species. Shepard is even capable of cheating on a partner with another romance option.<\/p><h3>Mass Effect<\/h3><p>Male Shepard -<\/p><p><a href=\"\/ashley-williams\/4005-83088\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83088\">Ashley Williams<\/a><\/p><p>Female Shepard -<\/p><p><a href=\"\/kaidan-alenko\/4005-83089\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83089\">Kaidan Alenko<\/a><\/p><p>Male\/Female Shepard -<\/p><p><a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/liara-tsoni\/4005-68418\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68418\">Liara T'Soni<\/a><\/p><h3>Mass Effect 2<\/h3><p>Male Shepard- <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/miranda-lawson\/4005-69592\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69592\">Miranda Lawson<\/a>, <a href=\"\/talizorah-nar-rayya\/4005-83090\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83090\">Tali'Zorah vas Normandy<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/jack\/4005-80055\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80055\">Jack<\/a><\/p><p>Female Shepard- <a href=\"\/jacob-taylor\/4005-83097\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83097\">Jacob Taylor<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/garrus-vakarian\/4005-83087\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83087\">Garrus Vakarian<\/a>, <a href=\"\/thane-krios\/4005-87028\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87028\">Thane Krios<\/a>.<\/p><p>Male\/Female Shepard- Kelly Chambers, <a href=\"\/samara\/4005-83095\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83095\">Samara<\/a>, Morinth<\/p><h3>Mass Effect 3<\/h3><p>Male Shepard- Miranda Lawson(Only if continued from Mass Effect 2), Tali'Zorah vas Normandy (Only if continued from Mass Effect 2), Jack (Only if continued from Mass Effect 2), Ashely Williams, and Steve Cortez(The first homosexual option for Male Shepard.<\/p><p>Female Shepard- Samantha Traynor, Garrus Vakarian(Only if continued from Mass Effect 2)<\/p><p>Male\/Female Shepard- Kaidan Alenko, Ashley Chambers (Only if continued from Mass Effect 2), Liara T'Soni, Diana Allers.<\/p><h2>Appearance<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3199847\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199847-tumblr_li40bdreij1qzkrfxo1_500.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.666\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199847-tumblr_li40bdreij1qzkrfxo1_500.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3199847\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199847-tumblr_li40bdreij1qzkrfxo1_500.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199847-tumblr_li40bdreij1qzkrfxo1_500.jpg 500w, http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/59032\/3199847-tumblr_li40bdreij1qzkrfxo1_500.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199847-tumblr_li40bdreij1qzkrfxo1_500.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59032\/3199847-tumblr_li40bdreij1qzkrfxo1_500.jpg 500w, http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/59032\/3199847-tumblr_li40bdreij1qzkrfxo1_500.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Shepard's appearance varies wildly, as is defined by the player and comes in millions of different variations.

Shepard can either be male or female; his\/her birthplace can be Earth, an off-world colony, or somewhere in space (ie. a ship or space station); and may have a sole survivor, war hero, or ruthless psychological trait.<\/p><p>At the time of the first Mass Effect, Shepard was born on April 11th, 2154 and is approximately 29 years old. He enlisted in the Alliance at 18 years old (2172) and is crew member aboard the SSV Normandy under Captain Anderson's command. Shepard's personality throughout the game is mostly determined by the choices the player makes in both dialogue and action.<\/p><h2>Portrayal<\/h2><p>Mark Meer provides the voice of Male Sheprad and Jennifer Hale provides the voice of Female Shepard.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>Commander Shepard is named after Alan Bartlett Shepard, Jr., the second person and the first American in space (May 5, 1961). He later commanded the Apollo 14 mission in 1971 and became the fifth person to walk on the Moon.<\/li><li>Shepard's birthday (April 11) is the same day that Apollo 13 (an American attempted manned moon landing mission that almost ended in disaster) was launched (April 11, 1970).<\/li><li>In the advertising for Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, only a male Commander Shepard was depicted. For Mass Effect 3, BioWare created a trailer featuring a female Commander Shepard for the first time. In addition, the box-art for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Mass Effect 3 was reversible, featuring a male Shepard on one side and a female Shepard on the other.<\/li><li>The default male face for Shepard is based on that of Dutch model Mark Vanderloo.<\/li><li>Shepard seems to speak with a hint of Canadian dialect. This may be because Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale, the voices of the male and female Shepard, respectively, are Canadian.<\/li><li>When Shepard is inducted as a Spectre, according to Admiral Hackett, Shepard is, technically, still part of the Alliance military (though Captain Anderson claims otherwise). Therefore, Shepard should still be referred to as a Commander, even though Shepard is outside of the Alliance military's chain of command and answers directly to the Council.<\/li><li>Military ranks can, in some situations, be deferred in favor of civilian ranks. Considering the nature and authority of Spectres, it is likely that this is considered to supersede any military rank.<\/li><li>The default names of both the male and female Shepard are the names for an unidentified male (John Doe) and female (Jane Doe) respectively.<\/li><li>To keep the exact nature of Shepard's return quiet in Mass Effect 2, it is often stated that the Commander almost died, which is not really truthful. The male Shepard would later joke with Jack that he is \"technically undead\".<\/li><li>When stopped by a C-Sec officer on their first return to the Citadel in Mass Effect 2, one of the dialogue options has Shepard say that he\/she was \"only mostly dead.\" This may be a reference to Miracle Max's line from The Princess Bride.<\/li><li>Commander Shepard appears in another Electronic Arts game, MySims SkyHeroes, as a pilot.<\/li><li>Renegade facial scarring in Mass Effect 2 is reminiscent of the effects of dark side corruption in BioWare's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, as morally questionable actions adversely affect the protagonist's appearance in both games.<\/li><li>BioWare held a contest prior to the release of Mass Effect 3 to allow fans to choose a new default face for female Commander Shepard.<\/li><\/ul>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-191277\/","id":191277,"name":"Part 1","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":85429,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/4338398-mf.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/4338398-mf.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/4338398-mf.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/4338398-mf.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/4338398-mf.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/4338398-mf.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/4338398-mf.jpg"},"name":"Commander Shepard","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-4\/","id":4,"name":"Human"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-364\/","id":364,"name":"Dark Horse Comics"},"real_name":"Shepard","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/commander-shepard\/4005-85429\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-85487\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":9,"date_added":"2012-09-02 14:31:44","date_last_updated":"2013-04-13 09:35:32","deck":"Glom is a member of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard.\nVery single-minded, Glom feeds on any form of matter or energy.

Thanos not only gleefully agreed, but was disgusted that he had actually created life, and annoyed that he didn't remember being intimate with Death.<\/p><p>Soon after, Thanos killed Rot with a blast so powerful, it was said to make the universe scream.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>Being the son of Abstract entity and Skyfather-level being, Rot probably had the capacity to develop vast powers on the level of his parents, including Matter and Reality altering powers, enhanced physical abilities, blasts and other powers far above the scope of most super-humans. He seemed to have no fixed form, and almost acted like a force of nature. He was slowly eating away at the universe, destroying it, and leaving various Avengers catatonic just by touching them. At the time of his death, his power was already such that his mother tasked his father to kill him, and the very scope of the blast Thanos used to dispatch his son indicates that he was a valid threat. Rot, being the son of the Embodiment of Death and the Avatar of Death, would have almost certainly been immortal if it wasn't for his untimely demise. However, the power of his parents means its possible he may return one day.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-73023\/","id":73023,"name":"Madonna Reborn","issue_number":"2"},"gender":0,"id":85692,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/4578714-rot.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/4578714-rot.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/4578714-rot.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/4578714-rot.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/4578714-rot.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/4578714-rot.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/4578714-rot.jpg"},"name":"Rot","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-7\/","id":7,"name":"God\/Eternal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":"Rot","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/rot\/4005-85692\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-85697\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":4,"date_added":"2012-09-17 15:13:59","date_last_updated":"2014-03-10 16:05:37","deck":"Former Vice-Captain of squad 13 of the Gotei 13 from the anime and manga series Bleach.
