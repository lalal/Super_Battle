While it turned out to be quite the menace, it was unable to stand being drenched in water and was supposedly destroyed.<\/p><p>Years later, however, the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid resurfaced after having assimilated the bodies of old, outdated Badniks. It had been hiding in <a href=\"\/robotropolis\/4020-55874\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55874\">Robotropolis<\/a> since it's first defeat and had managed to survive the nuclear holocaust unleashed upon the city by Eggman in an effort to turn The Great Forest into a radioactive wasteland.<\/p><p>Doctor Eggman, who had never created the Krudzu Hybrid Hydra in his universe, destroyed it before it could kill Sonic. Eggman's reasons for destroying the vile plant-like robot was because it had been a product of Robotnik Prime's genius, not his own, and he couldn't abide <a href=\"\/sonic\/4005-45343\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45343\">Sonic<\/a> dying at the hands of a machine that was not of his making. Despite Eggman's efforts, however, a sprig of the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid survived.<\/p><p>The sprig was later found by Eggman and <a href=\"\/snively\/4005-45330\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45330\">Snively<\/a>, who took it back to his laboratories and reprogrammed it to serve him. The Krudzu Hydra Hybrid was later fused with the body of an unused Titan Metal Sonic and was unleashed upon Team Fighters while they were pursuing the Death Egg Mark II across Mobius but the battle did not go in the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid's favor and it was pushed into the ocean, which destroyed the Titan Metal Sonic in the process, leaving it without a body.<\/p><p>The Krudzu Hydra Hybrid later appeared on the shores of what was once the Echidna settlement of Albion after having merged with a <a href=\"\/crabmeat\/4005-64654\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64654\">Crabmeat<\/a>, making it impervious to water. When it finally entered the ruins of Albion, the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid called out to see if there were any Eggman-loyal forces in the area but instead stumbled upon the guns left behind by the Echidnas whom Thrash the Tasmanian Devil had banished to another universe and the deactivated body of <a href=\"\/metal-knuckles\/4005-85671\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85671\">Metal Knuckles<\/a>.<\/p><p>Delighted by its new find, the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid abandoned the Crabmeat body it had been using and merged with Metal Knuckles' body and set out to find Sonic and his friends, who were already in Albion. The Krudzu Hydra Hybrid managed to sneak up on them while they were examining Thrash, who had been knocked into unconsciousness, <a href=\"\/knuckles\/4005-45315\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45315\">Knuckles the Echidna <\/a>and Team Fighters dueled with it but with the power of Metal Knuckles at its disposal it had become a true force to be reckoned with.<\/p><p>Knuckles was forced to leave the fight when Thrash woke back up and escaped from Albion through a warp ring, leaving Sonic, <a href=\"\/amy-rose\/4005-45317\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45317\">Amy<\/a> and <a href=\"\/tails\/4005-6680\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6680\">Tails<\/a> to face the mad hybrid alone. As the duel waged onward, Sonic and the others managed to disable the weapons that came with Metal Knuckles' body, but what they had failed to realize is that the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid could assimilate any form of technology to enhance itself with and fused Metal Knuckles body with the abandoned Dark Egg Legion and Albion-made technology laying all across the battlefield.<\/p><p>It was then that <a href=\"\/shard\/4005-84723\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84723\">Shard<\/a>, who had been assigned to keep Team Fighters safe and make sure their mission was a success, made his presence known and after a brief tiff with Team Fighters ganged up on the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid, who believed that Shard would make a nice addition to its already screwed up, hybridized form. After managing to get the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid to release Tails and Amy, Sonic and Shard dragged the abomination all around Albion at super-sonic speeds.<\/p><p>When they came full circle, Sonic and Shard tossed the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid at Amy, who had her hammer poised to strike and watched as she knocked it through several ruined buildings. Before it could recover, a group of Devil Dogs tore it to shreds, reducing it to nothing more than Metal Knuckles' head being supported by the vines that made up the Krudzu Hydra Hybrid's true form. Not willing to give up, however, it tried to get back up but before it could Shard, Sonic, Amy and Tails destroyed the rest of its body, leaving only a sprig.<\/p><p>But as Sonic was preparing to \"plant\" it in a place where there would be no technology for it to assimilate, Shard called a time out and convinced them to hand the sprig over to him, so he could take it back to New Mobotropolis to see if it could be modified into an antibody capable of deroboticizing <a href=\"\/princess-sally\/4005-6681\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6681\">Sally<\/a>.

They ended up with Apex, who would spend half of their time as Tim and half as Katy. Their parents kept them a secret, which infuriated Katy. She trained herself to be as powerful as she could possibly be, and caused a car accident, telling her parents that Tim was dead after suppressing him. She was sent to Braddock Academy, where she was trained, all while her brother watched, powerless to do anything. This is the story that Tim relays to the others, but it is debatable whether or not it is accurate.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Apex was created by writer <a href=\"\/dennis-hopeless\/4040-57959\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-57959\">Dennis Hopeless<\/a> and artist <a href=\"\/kevin-walker\/4040-43502\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43502\">Kevin Walker<\/a>.

She remained in the background, primarily acting at night or manipulating her classmates subtly. One spur of the moment dig at <a href=\"\/\">Kid Briton <\/a>weakened his resolved and, when a confrontation was forced by Arcade's teleportation technology to answer for the results of her manipulation, her world crumbled as what she had planned fell to ruin.<\/p><p>She managed to escape, but the death of Kid Briton left the control she sought over others and her surroundings shattered. This allowed Tim to take control of their body. He explained things to the rest of the people in Murderworld. Their history of her control and suppression of him and so on. They take a vote on whether or not to execute him in order to get to Katy before she returns. The majority voted to allow them to live, but decide to tie Tim up and place him under guard. However, when <a href=\"\/nico-minoru\/4005-1940\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1940\">Nico Minoru <\/a>has her back turned, Katy takes control again and kills Juston.<\/p><p>In the aftermath, she took Juston's body and his Sentinel away with her, only to toss the body aside for reasons known only to her while explaining to Death Lockette that she is going to win this competition, no matter what. <a href=\"\/\">X-23<\/a> and Chase manage to track her down (the later by accident), but she uses the Sentinel to stonewall X-23's bold strategy of . . . rushing head first into the enemy, and then takes control of Chase, who now wore the Darkhawk armor.<\/p><p>Throwing X-23's unconscious body at the gathered survivors (whom she apparently believed to be dead at the time, but was not), she launched an all out assault with the Sentinel and Death Lockette at her side. Of the teens, only Nico Minoru could hold her own against the insane teen. She managed to slow Katy down and teleport the others to the other side of the island. However, Nico was brutally attacked and left for dead when Katy brought Chase in to attack her.<\/p><p>Katy then went on burning the island down, to flush out her targets.<\/p><p>But Nico was not dead, and came back with a vengeance. Apex held her own against the witch, but with a word she utterly demolished the remains of the Sentinel, and literally disarmed Death Lockette. Seeing the end once again, she goaded Nico into attacking her.<\/p><p>Nico buried her and Death Lockette alive, but she lived, and found herself nestled amongst the machinery used to control Murder World.<\/p><p>And Arcade's Morgue.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>Apex claimed initially that she could only fly, although not very fast. She also stated herself to be a great manipulator and can - as she says herself - talk people into almost anything.<\/p><p>This obfuscated her true ability. Technopathy. She has been seen puppeting both Death Lockette and Darkhawk with relative ease, which might stem from the fact that both are heavily integrated with advanced technologies that provide her with the catalyst needed to manipulate them. However, this has yet to be expanded upon, and her talents in manipulation could be far more potent than she lets on. She also seemed to have let her skills with these powers atrophy in order to build up the initial false persona. Her initial, assumed, attempt to control Juston Seyfert's Sentinel resulted in its near total destruction (and the destruction of its A.I.), and her first attempt to control Darkhawk managed only in ripping the gem from the hero's torso.<\/p><p>She shares her body with her brother, Tim, and each struggles to gain control of the body, though Katy seems to have had control long enough to remain the dominant persona.

The Thorian is a unique creature with mind-controlling and telepathic abilities, and a massive sensory network. It releases spores into the air that allow the Thorian to control those who inhale them, using pain to control their behaviour. These 'thralls' then tend to the Thorian and obey its will.<\/p><p>Commander Shepard first hears of the Thorian from Lizbeth Baynham, who tentatively suggests that it might be why the geth are attacking the colonists on Feros. Once freed from the Thorian, Shiala then tells Shepard its history.<\/p><p>According to Shiala, the Thorian existed on Feros long before the Protheans arrived. It would spend thousands of years in hibernation, then awake for \"a few frantic centuries\" of activity before resting again. When the Protheans arrived and began building the metropolis that would eventually cover Feros, the curious Thorian studied them, likely made several of them into its thralls, and even absorbed them after they died, allowing them to become a part of its expanding consciousness.<\/p><p>From the Protheans, the Thorian's mind gradually absorbed the knowledge that would form the Cipher. The Thorian survived the cataclysm that destroyed the Protheans, and continued to grow across Feros for the next fifty thousand years.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-315386\/","id":315386,"name":"HC","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":87026,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2791826-feros_thorian_full_shot.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2791826-feros_thorian_full_shot.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2791826-feros_thorian_full_shot.png","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2791826-feros_thorian_full_shot.png","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2791826-feros_thorian_full_shot.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2791826-feros_thorian_full_shot.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2791826-feros_thorian_full_shot.png"},"name":"Thorian","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-3\/","id":3,"name":"Alien"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-364\/","id":364,"name":"Dark Horse Comics"},"real_name":"Thorian","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/thorian\/4005-87026\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-87123\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":2,"date_added":"2013-01-11 11:35:13","date_last_updated":"2013-05-07 18:45:20","deck":"A robot created by Galactus to help him in Secret Wars.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>When <a href=\"\/galactus\/4005-2149\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus <\/a>planned to consume <a href=\"\/battleworld\/4020-51065\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51065\">Battleworld<\/a>, the heroes obviously intervened.

Together, the parts of these victims would merge together to form the being known as Aggregate, a composite creature spawned by the damned to destroy the dark god Leviathan and his order of Cenobites.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Aggregate was created by <a href=\"\/daniel-g-chichester\/4040-42587\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42587\">Daniel G.

Pinhead, his ally <a href=\"\/atkins\/4005-82942\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82942\">Atkins<\/a> who'd traveled after him, and some of the time period's own Cenobites battled Aggregate, but it proved more dangerous than they'd thought and managed to kill several of the Cenobites. Atkins was about to kill Aggregate, that is until he took the Configuration from it and suddenly began coming undone. The puzzle turned out to be the one that had turned Atkins into a Cenobite in the first place, and his touching it had undone the order of time, making it so that he'd never existed as a Cenobite. Aggregate then took the puzzle and fled to find its next target, but became caught in some railroad tracks. As the train smashed Aggregate to pieces however, it took the puzzle with it and dared Pinhead to follow.<\/p><h3>Speak of the Devil<\/h3><p>Aggregate resurfaced in the year 1728 in Paris, where it had begun to sway a priest into helping find another of the Lament Configurations which had been buried with the priest's predecessor. Both Pinhead and the Cenobite <a href=\"\/balberith\/4005-86471\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86471\">Balberith<\/a> followed Aggregate to the time period, but Pinhead wound up having to battle with the spirit of his previous incarnation and Balberith proved to be no challenge in a fight with Aggregate. The priest then helped Aggregate find the puzzle, this being the one that had created Balberith and so she became undone like Atkins. Aggregate then departed as Pinhead was still fighting his past self. When Pinhead emerged victorious soon after, he confronted the priest and realized that he'd actually kept a final piece of the puzzle from Aggregate. Pinhead took the piece and followed Aggregate once again.<\/p><h3>The Devil Bides His Day<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2833267\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2964912280702\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2833267\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg 570w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg 493w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg 570w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/2833267-aggregate_pinhead_4_aiding_the_chachapoyan.jpg 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Now in South America in 627 A.D., Aggregate had begun to rally the forces of a Mayan tribe to attack another tribe that had begun worshiping Leviathan. Using knowledge from its many creators, Aggregate had even begun instructing the tribe in innovate new warfare tactics and weaponry. Pinhead had meanwhile taken to this time period's incarnation of him and was followed by the Cenobite, <a href=\"\/face\/4005-86470\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86470\">Face<\/a>, to assist him. When Aggregate came with his army, Pinhead and Face fought bravely, but Pinhead once again wound up being disrupted by his past self's spirit and was left to Aggregate's lack of mercy. Face was luckily able to divert a beam of energy from an intricate Lament Configuration puzzle that had been set up, and used it to destroy Aggregate's body, albeit at the cost of his own life.<\/p><h3>The Devil in Disguise<\/h3><p>Aggregate now came into the Bronze Age, in the city of Ur in ancient Sumer. Here it sought to sway a priestess of Ishtar into aiding its crusade for the Lament Configurations, a priestess who happened to be the lover of this time period's Pinhead. Aggregate managed to sway her by showing its \"mastery\" over life and death by using a martial arts move to stop a servant's heart, and then resuscitating her with CPR afterwards. Pinhead had at this time begun searching for the Configuration, but was distracted by his past self's feelings for the priestess. Luckily, the Cenobite <a href=\"\/gehenna\/4005-86474\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86474\">Gehenna<\/a> had followed Pinhead and was able to reason with him. Aggregate had now begun unlocking the configuration with the priestess, in this case the invention of iron in the Bronze Age. Pinhead tried to stop Aggregate, but his past self again interfered due to heartbreak over the priestess' betrayal. Gehenna then lunged at the priestess, pushing them both into a furnace, and tore out her heart for interfering with his master's work. Gehenna was unable to survive the flames, but the blood from the priestess managed to temper the furnace's ore into iron, unlocking the puzzle. Pinhead and Aggregate then battled each other with pieces of the iron. Pinhead gained the upper hand, but Aggregate slipped away into another time period before it could receive the finishing blow.<\/p><h3>Give the Devil His Due<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2833280\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833280-aggregate_pinhead_6_orders_from_masters.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.9504373177843\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:195.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833280-aggregate_pinhead_6_orders_from_masters.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2833280\"><img alt=\"Aggregate's creators yearn for their freedom.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px\" data-width=\"328\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/2833280-aggregate_pinhead_6_orders_from_masters.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833280-aggregate_pinhead_6_orders_from_masters.jpg 343w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/2833280-aggregate_pinhead_6_orders_from_masters.jpg 328w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Aggregate's creators yearn for their freedom.\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/2833280-aggregate_pinhead_6_orders_from_masters.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833280-aggregate_pinhead_6_orders_from_masters.jpg 343w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/2833280-aggregate_pinhead_6_orders_from_masters.jpg 328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px\" data-width=\"328\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Aggregate's creators yearn for their freedom.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Aggregate now came into prehistoric times, where it quickly found Pinhead's neanderthal incarnation and subdued him before Pinhead could overcome the spirit of his past self. Aggregate then set to its true purpose, using the Lament Configurations and knowledge it had acquired throughout time and built a construct from them, a construct that had been long ago designed by one of Leviathan's victims, a construct to destroy Leviathan. Once completed, Aggregate activated it with parts of its composite soul, and the construct began tearing Leviathan out of Hell and into the world of the living, where it could be rendered powerless and destroyed. Leviathan's victims now began flowing out of it and reclaiming the parts of themselves that they'd given to Aggregate. Aggregate became concerned however, as this meant its own existence would be coming to an end. Having gained control of his past self however, Pinhead arrived and used the puzzle piece that he'd acquired from the priest back in Paris, a lens, to set fire to the construct, allowing Leviathan to return back to Hell. Its escaped victims quickly decided they'd rather return to Leviathan rather than face the wrath of Pinhead. Aggregate didn't want to return since it wanted nothing more than to live for itself now, although at the same time it didn't want to be left alone, and so it was left to simply mourn the passing of its creators.<\/p><p>With Aggregate defeated, Pinhead took back the Lament Configurations and brought back Atkins and Balberith back, although he was uncertain of whether or not Face and Gehenna could be brought back due to their having died rather than having been undone from time. Pinhead then told Aggregate that even though he felt that Aggregate could have become a fine Cenobite, its desire for individuality had no place in their order. Pinhead therefore had Atkins do what he did best and Aggregate was shot to pieces, effectively ending its semblance of life.<\/p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2833270\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833270-aggregate_pinhead_4_reflection.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1002570694087\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833270-aggregate_pinhead_4_reflection.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2833270\"><img alt=\"Aggregate's many selves.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\" data-width=\"581\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833270-aggregate_pinhead_4_reflection.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833270-aggregate_pinhead_4_reflection.jpg 389w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Aggregate's many selves.\" src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833270-aggregate_pinhead_4_reflection.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/2833270-aggregate_pinhead_4_reflection.jpg 389w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\" data-width=\"581\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Aggregate's many selves.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Through the dimensional nature of Leviathan, its victims are able to partially escape into almost any point in time and have their pieces merge to form Aggregate, essentially allowing it to travel through time.
