That's when they started to send back a cyborg or machine to kill all of the Connors. The Connors are the ones who will rebel in the future. The cyborg killed two of the three but, was stopped by a time traveler named <a href=\"\/kyle-reese\/4005-58939\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58939\">Kyle Reese<\/a>. Kyle tells Sarah who is the last Connor that the cyborg was called the Terminator who was trying to kill her. They were invented by <a href=\"\/skynet\/4060-55951\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55951\">Skynet<\/a> to destroy all humans.<\/p><p>He tells her that she will have a son named John Connor who will lead the rebeling team in the future. That's why they sent the terminator back to kill her. So she won't have her son to lead the rebel. This would make the machines win in the future. The Terminator does not feel pain. His mission is to kill the Connors. When Kyle is done telling Sarah everything the cyborg strikes again. This causes a car chase. But, in doing this Sarah gets arrested. The police say her story is crazy and stupid. That's when the Terminator arrives at the police station and kills most of the police there. Sarah escapes from the Terminator with Kyle.<\/p><p>When they were at a motel Kyle confesses his love towards her and she loves him to. Then the Terminator shows up and Kyle gets shot but, is still alive. That's when Sarah shot a tanker truck. The cyborg is thought to have been killed. But, the bare metal form rises up and attacks them again. That's when Kyle put a bomb in the cyborg's stomach and blew off the cyborgs legs but, this also killed Kyle. Then Sarah puts the machine in a machine press and kills it.<\/p><h2>Films<\/h2><h3>Terminator<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794443\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38511\/794443-terminator_1.png\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38511\/794443-terminator_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794443\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38511\/794443-terminator_1.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38511\/794443-terminator_1.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/a><\/figure><p>In the first terminator movie, the cyborg is sent to kill <a href=\"\/sarah-connor\/4005-15997\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15997\">Sarah Connor<\/a> before she conceives a future rebel leader, <a href=\"\/john-connor\/4005-15996\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15996\">John Connor<\/a>.

He is best known for being one of the most powerful and terrifying adversaries of Doctor Strange. It is seemingly impossible to permanently destroy this evil god.","description":"<h2>Origins<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like its brothers, Shuma-Gorath was originally one of the many nightmares that plagued the first daemons in the earliest days of Creation and was physically manifested in the spaces between universes as a memory-echo of those nightmares. Back then, they were known only as the \" <a href=\"\/the-many-angled-ones\/4060-57340\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57340\">Many-Angled Ones<\/a>\" and were not considered separate beings until they finally managed to create their own individual identities and personalities.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Shuma-Gorath finally gained its own identity, it slipped through a fissure in time and space and ended up on Earth-616, where it took control of the planet during the Jurassic Age. During that time, Shuma-Gorath created <a href=\"\/quoggoth\/4005-19150\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19150\">Quoggoth<\/a>, who was his disciple for a time until he came to believe himself more powerful than his many-angled master. Quoggoth rebelled against his master, but Shuma-Gorath defeated Quoggoth and sealed him away inside an ancient sepulcher before sinking it into the ocean as punishment for his betrayal. It was presumed that no one would be able to find the sunken sepulcher, but centuries later <a href=\"\/magneto\/4005-1441\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto<\/a> would prove Shuma-Gorath wrong by returning the island to the surface and begin using it as a base.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath\u2019s identity was first revealed by the dark priestess <a href=\"\/ebora\/4005-37085\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37085\">Ebora<\/a>, servant of the great one <a href=\"\/sligguth\/4005-23140\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23140\">Sligguth<\/a>. She reveals to a confused <a href=\"\/doctor-strange\/4005-1456\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange<\/a> that in the long-forgotten eons of Earth, in the primal days of its beginning, Shuma-Gorath was all and obedience to its will was the wish of all creatures. Its name was \u201cwhispered in reverence by every living thing\u201d. According to Ebora, as the eons passed, Shuma-Gorath yearned for rest and took refuge within the vaults of Earth itself in order to dream and lie in wait until the time came for its final awakening. It is revealed that sometime during Shuma-Gorath\u2019s rule on earth the <a href=\"\/vishanti\/4060-27218\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27218\">Vishanti<\/a> attempted to defeat it, yet they were unsuccessful.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, Shuma-Gorath would have its reign ended by <a href=\"\/sise-neg\/4005-63424\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63424\">Sise-Neg<\/a>, the time-traveling sorcerer from the 31st Century who would eventually recreate the Marvel Universe. Sise-Neg was reluctant to fight Shuma-Gorath directly, as it would absorb his magical energy from him, so Sise-Neg put Shuma-Gorath in a slumber as it was devouring the human ancestors and sent it to a far off dimension.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the Hyborian era Shuma-Gorath managed to once again enter our world. However this era was marked by abounding sorcery and tremendous warriors, among them <a href=\"\/conan\/4005-2438\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2438\">Conan<\/a>, who once or twice came to face the creature. During this time Shuma-Gorath made enemies with <a href=\"\/crom\/4005-32255\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32255\">Crom<\/a> the Grim God, one the most powerful Hyborian gods, who used the power from the <a href=\"\/iron-bound-books-of-shuma-gorath\/4055-51657\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-51657\">Iron-Bound Books of Shuma-Gorath<\/a> to seal him under a mountain that came to be known as Crom\u2019s mountain. Several attempts were made by the creature to escape, however, by the pre-Cataclysmic era it was banished by Crom, who once again used the power of Shuma-Gorath's Iron-Bound Books.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Many eons later, Shuma-Gorath attempted to renew its reign of terror on Earth by using the <a href=\"\/ancient-one\/4005-2212\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2212\">Ancient One<\/a>\u2019s mind as its gateway. It employed a number of Gods and demons as servants to destroy Doctor Strange as he was a hindrance to Shuma-Gorath\u2019s plans. However, Strange defeated every one of Shuma-Gorath\u2019s servants and as he was traveling from the planet <a href=\"\/kathulos\/4005-65619\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65619\">Kathulos<\/a>, which he had just destroyed, Doctor Strange was finally spoken to directly by Shuma-Gorath with the words, <i>\u201cSo thou knowest the essence of Shuma-Gorath, eh, Doctor Strange? Aye\u2014evil! Ancient, timeless\u2026patient\u2026evil! And Shuma-Gorath doth know thee.\u201d<\/i> Shuma-Gorath revealed to the doctor that it awaited his return to Earth.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Finally, Shuma-Gorath\u2019s voice bubbled forth from the Ancient One\u2019s brow and a negative image of the Ancient One burst forth to taunt Stephen Strange foretelling that the entire Earth will succumb to evil. Not long after, Shuma-Gorath sucked Doctor Strange into the Ancient One\u2019s mind dragging him into an endless abyss and then taunting him with <a href=\"\/dormammu\/4005-2205\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\">Dormammu<\/a>\u2019s image admitting inferiority to Shuma-Gorath\u2019s power. Just as Strange resisted the images Shuma-Gorath finally revealed its true form and clenched the struggling doctor in its tentacled grasp, feeding off the energy Strange exerted to try and free himself. Strange managed to free himself after Shuma-Gorath focused on destroying Strange\u2019s thought double. Racing toward the Ancient One\u2019s ego, Doctor Strange murdered the Ancient One as was the Ancient One\u2019s will, thus preventing Shuma-Gorath from fully entering the universe and leaving it back in its home dimension.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Nevertheless, Shuma-Gorath once again was able to assault the Earth due to Doctor Strange destroying all of his magical artifacts in order to save his comrades from the sorcerer <a href=\"\/urthona\/4005-21581\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21581\">Urthona<\/a>. Destroying these artifacts in effect destroyed the magical barriers that kept the <a href=\"\/the-great-old-ones\/4060-48427\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48427\">Old Ones<\/a> from entering Earth's dimension. Aware that the magical barriers were eliminated, Shuma-Gorath commanded the Old Ones to begin their assault on Earth. - the <a href=\"\/water-elemental\/4005-79272\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79272\">Water Elemental<\/a>, <a href=\"\/erlic-khan\/4005-29688\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29688\">Erlik Khan<\/a>, <a href=\"\/nightmare\/4005-2646\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2646\">Nightmare<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/ghaszaszh-nyirh\/4005-79234\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79234\">Ghaszaszh Nyirh<\/a> were included in this assault. The actions of the Old Ones forced Strange to take innocent lives to save his own, corrupting Strange in the process and preventing him from using his usual White Magic. Thus, he was forced to accept tutoring from the Ancient One's wicked rival, <a href=\"\/kaluu\/4005-28991\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28991\">Kaluu<\/a>. Strange's confrontations with some of the Old Ones allowed him to amass black magic power that eventually enabled him to surpass his previous level of power to a large degree. Even still, the Old Ones spanned the entire globe, and as they wreaked havoc around the Earth, Strange and Kaluu assembled an army of sprite demons to fight against them. Realizing that they could not hope to prevail unless they cut off the source of the assault, Strange and Kaluu decided that they had to confront the source of the Old Ones directly. Strange followed Kaluu toward Shuma\u2019s home dimension located 1,000 dimensional planes away from Earth. However, upon reaching the 998th plane, the evil energy overpowered Kaluu and began to kill him. Fortunately for Strange, he was unaffected by the realm's alien energy as the amount of black magic coursing through his body brought him to a level of power that even surpassed his former master, the Ancient One.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It was then that a floored Kaluu revealed with a mouth full of foam that the energy in Shuma\u2019s lesser realm made the demons that attack Earth, <a href=\"\/mephisto\/4005-2635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto<\/a> and <a href=\"\/satannish\/4005-13799\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13799\">Satannish<\/a>, look like \u201cmice in a great temple\u201d. Strange continued the journey alone to face Shuma-Gorath but found himself in the dimension of the chaos lord <a href=\"\/arioch\/4005-64936\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64936\">Arioch<\/a>. This long-haired demon armed with a sword and chain armor revealed itself as being as powerful as it wished to be, and not even finite. Strange could not hope to stand up against that power, and so he defeated the chaos lord by merging his body with it and losing much of his identity in the process. After the fusion with the chaos lord he made his way to Shuma-Gorath\u2019s Chaos Dimension.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath welcomed Strange\/Arioch and revealed to him that he was ruler of hundreds of dimensions. Strange used his magic to match the chaos demon in size and a grueling battle began. Shuma-Gorath struck Strange with its tentacles, revealing to him that he was in the process of turning into a lord of chaos himself. Shuma told Strange that should he defeat him he will eventually succumb to the evil energy and turn into Shuma-Gorath, and with that he created a replica of the planet Earth and proceeded to surround the replica in a ring of fire which harmed the real Earth.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath, sure of its victory, declared <i>\u201cYou cannot be the preserver and the destroyer in one aspect, Strange! You cannot be Vishnu and Shiva with the same sweep of the hand! There is simply no way you can win!\u201d<\/i> Doctor Strange decided that he would choose the path of Shiva the destroyer and hurled Shuma\u2019s own magically generated image at it. It appeared that at long last Shuma-Gorath was annihilated. In order to prevent himself from one day becoming a new Shuma-Gorath, Strange pierced himself with one of Shuma-Gorath's tentacles and killed his ego, just as he did to the Ancient One.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Doctor Strange returned to the dimension where he left Kaluu and attempted to go back to Earth, but the power emanating from him that he absorbed from Shuma-Gorath caused a massive explosion that prevented Kaluu from opening the gateway back to their reality. Kaluu revealed to Doctor Strange that that power would destroy galaxies just by Strange being in the vicinity, and so Strange was forced to release some of that power before moving on. The power absorbed from Shuma-Gorath was so vast that even after Strange released enough energy to return to a lower dimensional plane, Strange almost caused Kaluu to \"<i>die like a leaf in a bonfire<\/i>\" by merely blocking Kaluu's strike with his forearm - Kaluu had attempted to make Strange release his infinite power and return to normal.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath was not permanently defeated, as after Strange bled out all of the energy gained from the battle with Shuma-Gorath it all reformed back in Shuma\u2019s realm and the demon was revived. Shuma-Gorath made its way to Earth once again in a severely hungry state when the sorcerer <a href=\"\/nicholas-scratch\/4005-14115\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14115\">Nicholas Scratch<\/a> deceived the Fantastic Four into reciting an incantation from a book that brought the monster to their world. It easily defeated the <a href=\"\/fantastic-four\/4060-3804\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four<\/a> even in its horribly weakened condition and found itself in an off-panel battle with Doctor Strange once again as he transported them both to Stonehenge. Shuma-Gorath was once again banished back to its dimension but not before it almost killed Stephen Strange.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">On <a href=\"\/the-cancerverse\/4020-56640\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56640\">Earth-10011<\/a>, a world where the unspeakable influence of Shuma-Gorath and its brothers Kthl, Yot-Soter and Nyerlathortech, was much greater than in most other universes, the legendary Kree hero known as <a href=\"\/captain-marvel\/4005-1472\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Mar-Vell<\/a> was dying of cancer. When news of his terminal illness broke out, the distress felt by Mar-Vell's friends and the global populaces who adored him created an immense wave of empathic trauma that was felt by all of the Many-Angled Ones. And when they felt it, Shuma-Gorath and its brethren reached into the dying Mar-Vell's mind and offered to solve the problem, Mar-Vell was almost too eager to accept their offer and gave unto them his mind, his body and his very soul. In order to \"justify\" their invasion, they urged Mar-Vell to join hands with his comrades. By doing so, they were able to infect and transmute those closest to Mar-Vell with their influence and set Earth-10011 on the path to devastation.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After <a href=\"\/death\/4005-12620\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Mistress Death<\/a> was obliterated via a ritual called the \"Necropsy\", Shuma-Gorath and its brethren were able to smash down the doors separating them from Earth-10011 and fill the entire reality, transforming it into the nightmarish Cancerverse. But one universe was not enough to satisfy their needs, the Many-Angled Ones needed more space to fill and so their pawns on Earth-10011 began thinking of ways they could give Shuma-Gorath and the others what they desired the most.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For a great deal of time, the option of expanding into other realities was not available, that is until a war between the Kree and Shi'ar on Earth-616 literally ripped the very fabric of time\/space apart and opened a multidimensional fault-line through the Multiverse with Earth-616 sitting naked, defenseless and all too ripe for the picking on the other side. <a href=\"\/adam-warlock\/4005-6805\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\">Adam Magus<\/a>, who learned of the Cancerverse and its masters via unknown means, struck a deal with Shuma-Gorath's people that would grant the demon and its ilk entry into the Marvel Universe.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For several months, Adam Magus filled several worlds under the control of his <a href=\"\/the-universal-church-of-truth\/4060-54776\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54776\">Universal Church of Truth<\/a> with as many of his followers as he possibly could, and then on the day of reckoning he teleported all of the planets to the base of \" <a href=\"\/the-fault\/4020-56597\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56597\">The Fault<\/a>\" and detonated them. The nearly infinite amount of belief energy Magus had sacrificed to Shuma-Gorath and its ilk was so great that it tore The Fault open even wider until there was barely even a parsec of space separating Earth-616 from The Cancerverse. As the two realities went to war, the Many-Angled Ones patiently waited for their puppet, Mar-Vell, to capture <a href=\"\/thanos\/4005-7607\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos<\/a> of 616 and carry out the Necropsy once again. Shuma-Gorath and its ilk were eventually summoned in a merged form back to The Cancerverse, directly over the site where the first Necropsy rite had been preformed, where they found Mar-Vell preparing to carry out the last stage of the ritual.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Things, however, did not go as they had planned. When Mar-Vell struck Thanos with the Infinity Sacrificial Blade, he accidentally allowed the Mistress Death of Earth-616 into The Cancerverse, who slaughtered Mar-Vell and in turn destroyed the entire universe. Mar-Vell's death had crippled all of The Many-Angled Ones save for Shuma-Gorath itself, who left its brethren for dead and high-tailed itself back to The Chaos Dimension.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sometime later, while recovering from its defeat at the hands of Mistress Death, Shuma-Gorath found itself being brought back to Earth-616 itself for the first time since the Nicolas Scratch incident by the power of the legendary <a href=\"\/spear-of-destiny\/4055-47001\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47001\">Spear of Destiny<\/a>. With the aid of its minions, <a href=\"\/arnim-zola\/4005-14876\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14876\">Arnim Zola<\/a> and <a href=\"\/battle-axis\/4060-55692\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55692\">The Battle-Axis<\/a>, Shuma-Gorath nearly succeeded in his plan to consume all of reality only to end up being stabbed in the eye with The Spear of Destiny by <a href=\"\/aarkus\/4005-7261\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7261\">The Vision<\/a> and forced back into the rift bridging the gaps between its Universe and ours<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Most recently Shuma-Gorath, along with Elder Gods such as <a href=\"\/chthon\/4005-15683\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15683\">Chthon<\/a> and <a href=\"\/set\/4005-29092\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29092\">Set<\/a>, were seen gathered together within an area of <a href=\"\/living-tribunal\/4005-6811\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6811\">The Living Tribunal's<\/a> <a href=\"\/the-infinite-embassy\/4020-57910\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57910\">Infinite Embassy<\/a> called The Devil's Advocacy, which is nearly identical to the Christian version of Hell. It is also where The Living Tribunal has placed the throne of the true Satan to keep it and the power it is imbued with from falling into the wrong hands.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ebony Maw, one of Thanos' generals, took control of Doctor Strange's mind during Thanos' invasion of Earth, during that time Maw forced Strange to tear down the barriers between Earth-616 and the Chaos Dimension. Once they were down, Shuma-Gorath appeared in downtown Manhattan before the new Mighty Avengers and proclaimed that the Earth was his. Shuma-Gorath starts destroying things around him and grabs Luke Cage, taunting him before Blue Marvel bursts through his eyeball, downing the demon temporarily. Blue Marvel asks what the demon is and Spider-Hero responds \"Shuma-Gorath. Or the smallest part of it - like a fingernail scratching at our reality. Trying to tear through.\" Spider-Hero then says that in about two minutes Shuma-Gorath's physical manifestation will reform and that they need to disrupt its astral self before Shuma-Gorath gets too big of a foothold on Earth (which would give Shuma-Gorath more of its true power). <\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath suddenly reforms and possesses a horde of civilians, causing tentacles to burst out of their mouths. A plan is devised by the Mighty Avengers that amplifies White Tiger's amulet with the chi-energy of all Manhattan before the White Tiger Force is unleashed from it. The White Tiger Force tells the manifestation of Shuma-Gorath that the Earth is his and proceeds to eat it, ending the threat of Shuma-Gorath on Earth for the time being. <\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Upon his inception in Marvel Comics by the author Steve Englehart, Shuma-Gorath was portrayed to be the most magically powerful evil god within the Marvel universe. Shuma-Gorath is most powerful in its home dimension as it is omnipotent in every sense of the word, being the realm itself. It is not quite as powerful in its lesser realms and even less so in a realm not belonging to it, yet even in one of its lesser realm its power was stated to make the powerful demons <a href=\"\/mephisto\/4005-2635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto<\/a> and <a href=\"\/satannish\/4005-13799\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13799\">Satannish<\/a> look like \u201cmice in a great temple\u201d.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath is able to travel dimensions freely, invading alternate dimensions and conquering then absorbing them. Shuma-Gorath has revealed that it is ruler of hundreds of dimensions including <a href=\"\/the-cancerverse\/4020-56640\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56640\">The Cancerverse<\/a>. <\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Shuma-Gorath is summoned, only the merest fraction of its essence gains a foothold into the realm it is summoned to at first, as it takes time for Shuma-Gorath's full essence to traverse across realms from its home dimension. This means that Shuma-Gorath is summoned at the tiniest bit of its true power, explaining how lesser beings are able to put up a fight against Shuma-Gorath on Earth. Even with so little of Shuma-Gorath's true power being summoned, it is still able to overwhelm others and requires great effort for it to be banished or destroyed.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath can phase through objects, levitate, turn into liquid and shape shift into any form it so desires. It also has incredible reality warping powers; however the full scope of its reality warping ability is still unknown.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Unlike many demons, Shuma-Gorath generates its own magical energy without having to gather it from another source. However, it is able to draw magical energy from others if it so chooses. Shuma-Gorath is able to feed off of any kind of energy and drain it from others whether it be magical in nature or otherwise.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath has incredible telepathic power and can communicate with and control minds from dimensions away. It can also lend its power to other entities or sorcerers if it so desires. Shuma-Gorath has also been shown to summon hordes of demons to attack enemies if it does not feel like going through the trouble doing the job itself.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath has been shown to shoot energy blasts either from its gigantic eyeball or its tentacles. Shuma-Gorath has no real weaknesses to speak of and has only been harmed by the most powerful magic spells and cosmic abstracts. It is unknown whether it can actually be destroyed permanently seeing as how it reformed after what appeared to be certain destruction.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It also has a rubbery and armored hide giving it additional defenses from attacks. Shuma-Gorath\u2019s intelligence pushes omniscience and it could possibly rank among the smartest entities in the Marvel Universe.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath\u2019s power is so formidable that it has a variety of chaos lords and other such gods, demons, and sorcerers that willfully do its bidding.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At some point Shuma-Gorath and the Vishanti (Oshtur, Agamotto, Hoggoth) became enemies and fought through unknown circumstances. <\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The power Doctor Strange absorbed from Shuma-Gorath was potent enough to be capable of destroying galaxies just by being present.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The time-traveling sorcerer Sise-Neg did not want to attempt to destroy Shuma-Gorath for fear of losing energy, even after he had absorbed near everything in the Marvel Universe.<\/p><h2>Other Media<\/h2><h3>Video games<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/75522\/1387256-msh_6_thumb_ign.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1387256\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/75522\/1387256-msh_6_thumb_ign.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1387256\"><img alt=\"Shuma fighting Hulk in Marvel Super Heroes\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/75522\/1387256-msh_6_thumb_ign.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/75522\/1387256-msh_6_thumb_ign.jpg 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\"><\/a><figcaption>Shuma fighting Hulk in Marvel Super Heroes<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shuma-Gorath gained quite the popularity as one the oddball playable characters (along with <a href=\"\/blackheart\/4005-14728\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14728\">Blackheart<\/a>) in Marvel Super Heroes.

(Earth-238), <a href=\"\/mad-jim-jaspers\/4005-31996\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31996\">Mad Jim Jaspers<\/a> created the Fury to kill all superhumans save himself. Jaspers was a being capable of altering reality, so though the Fury is mechanical, it isn't like any other machine or cyborg. Part robot, part living flesh, the Fury is certainly one of the most feared supervillains due its killing efficiency and durability. Fury did what it was programmed and killed every superhero in its world except for <a href=\"\/captain-uk\/4005-14822\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14822\">Captain UK<\/a>, who escaped to Earth-616. Mad Jim Jaspers was found to be too dangerous so the temporal overseer destroyed Earth-238, but the Fury escaped to Earth-616 where it continued its mission to kill superhumans. Fury also found this reality's Mad Jim Jaspers and decided that since he wasn't the original Jaspers, it could kill him. They battled. Jim could alter reality, but the Fury could adapt itself in order to counter anything Jim did. So, they were at a stalemate until the Fury transported them both to the now empty void where Earth-238 had been. Mad Jim had no reality to manipulate so the Fury killed him. When it returned, the <a href=\"\/crazy-gang\/4060-14821\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14821\">Crazy Gang<\/a>, then <a href=\"\/captain-britain\/4005-7477\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\">Captain Britain<\/a>, and finally Captain UK attacked it while it was still weak, each further damaging it before being overpowered, until Captain U.K. finally destroyed it.<\/p><h3>Earth-616 Fury<\/h3><p>A severely weakened version of the Fury was created by <a href=\"\/jamie-braddock\/4005-4270\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4270\">Jamie Braddock<\/a> (Uncanny X-Men #444) to test the <a href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men<\/a>. On the first go-round it broke <a href=\"\/cannonball\/4005-1496\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\">Cannonball's<\/a> leg, knocked <a href=\"\/rachel-grey\/4005-3566\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel<\/a> into the sky, knocked out <a href=\"\/bishop\/4005-1503\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop<\/a> and came close to killing each of them individually. He then used <a href=\"\/sage\/4005-4559\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4559\">Sage's<\/a> glasses to take over her mind. It was only defeated when Rachel Grey created a black hole inside of it, with the help of <a href=\"\/storm\/4005-1444\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm<\/a>, Sage and Bishop, sucking it in and teleporting it away, but not destroying it.

Its powers exists as long as he needs them. Since it can give itself any power it needs, no list of its powers would ever be complete. It is able to see superhumans' weaknesses and adapts itself accordingly, to help kill them all. It can find a way to kill anything and survive in any situation. From every attack used against it, The Fury learns to neutralize it. The Fury is also virtually impossible to destroy. If even the smallest part of it remains, it can rebuild itself completely by using surrounding materials. The greatest showing of this is that it was the only thing to survive when the entire reality Earth-238 was destroyed (Daredevils #6).<\/p><p>The Fury has great analytical and tracking devices. It can even track its targets between dimensions; so it is almost impossible to escape it. The Fury would never stop until it has accomplished its goal to exterminate all super-humans. The Earth-616 version of the Fury was severely reduced in capability compared to the Earth-238 version, but still posed a lethal threat to the X-Men. <\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>Physical Characteristics<\/b> <\/p><p>Height: 7'6\"<\/p><p>Weight: 600 lbs<\/p><p>Hair: None<\/p><p>Eyes: Gold and Red<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-157574\/","id":157574,"name":"A Crooked World","issue_number":"387"},"gender":0,"id":14489,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/3885684-the%20fury.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/3885684-the%20fury.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/3885684-the%20fury.png","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/3885684-the%20fury.png","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/3885684-the%20fury.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/3885684-the%20fury.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/3885684-the%20fury.png"},"name":"The Fury","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-2\/","id":2,"name":"Cyborg"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/the-fury\/4005-14489\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-14513\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":2,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:20","date_last_updated":"2011-05-05 16:55:16","deck":null,"description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-66628\/","id":66628,"name":"Air-Walker To Death-Stalker","issue_number":"16"},"gender":0,"id":14513,"image":null,"name":"Margo","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/margo\/4005-14513\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-14527\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":42,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:54","date_last_updated":"2013-04-19 03:15:35","deck":"The Uni-Mind is a collective organism that is created when the Eternals all merge together.

It sensed the potential to be alive in the techno-organic being known as <a href=\"\/wiki\/Warlock_%28New_Mutants%29\/\" data-ref-id=\"Warlock_%28New_Mutants%29\">Douglock<\/a> and gave it independence from the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Phalanx_%28comics%29\/\" data-ref-id=\"Phalanx_%28comics%29\">Phalanx<\/a>. Zero set out to teach Douglock about his new existence, but Zero was now hunted by killer androids, programmed by Stryfe to destroy Zero in case of his death. Zero and Douglock were assisted by <a href=\"\/excalibur\/4060-14864\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14864\">Excalibur<\/a> and together they tried to deactivate the androids from Stryfe's secret base below the Pentagon. Here, Zero realized that he had become sentient and also the reason why Stryfe wanted him killed: locked within his databanks, Zero had all the secrets of the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Legacy_Virus\/\" data-ref-id=\"Legacy_Virus\">Legacy Virus<\/a>, Stryfe's final \"gift\" to the world. This revelation activated Zero's self-destruct sequence and the killer androids in Stryfe's base. <a href=\"\/wiki\/Shadowcat\/\" data-ref-id=\"Shadowcat\">Shadowcat<\/a> managed to remove the self-destruction device, but Zero realised that his sentience was a cruel joke played on him by Stryfe; it was just programmed to think it was alive. Zero sacrificed itself to protect Excalibur, Douglock and a family of innocents from the base's self-destruction, but in its last few moments on Earth, Stryfe showed his cruelty again: Zero was granted full sentience and had become truly alive, but also set off a self-destruct device in the base to kill Zero. As this happened, a recording of Stryfe delivered the taunting message, \"Congratulations. You're human. For the next eight seconds.\" In its last moments on Earth, Zero transferred all of its memories to Douglock. So while its body is destroyed, the data that made up Zero's mind is still contained within the mind of Douglock (currently known as <a href=\"\/warlock\/4005-7223\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7223\">Warlock<\/a>).<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Teleportation: Zero is capable of opening gateways linking to places spatially without having to traverse the space betweeen.<\/p><h2>Personality<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Zero does what he is told.

He worked alongside his creator when he masqueraded as Erik the Red during the trial of Gambit for his role in the Morlock Massacre. This was made at Magneto's citadel in Antarctica where he ensured that the court proceeded in proper order when the X-Men were kept as prisoners. The X-Men managed to escape the citadel with Magneto also leaving his headquarters where Ferris assisted in removing the Erik the Red armor though Magnus commanded the machine to ensure that it was not destroyed as he might use it again in the future. Afterwards, Magneto began his plans in ensuring the ascendance of Mutants by controlling the magnetic field of the entire planet through the creation of a polar tower that enhanced his abilities. The construction of the artifice was made by Ferris along with similar such drones where Magnus intended to hold the world hostage by shutting down all technology He dispatched his loyal minion Ferris to deliver his ultimatum to the United Nations. The demands led to the United Nation's gifting Genosha as a safe haven for Mutants. Ferris later returned to his master's side after he was wounded when his powers accidently caused a tear in the Earth's atmosphere that was only sealed by the sacrifice of
