However, this prototype was destroyed in a fight between Diamond and Diamond's ancient enemy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2998\" href=\"\/wolfe\/4005-2998\/\" slug=\"wolfe\">Wolfe<\/a>. The resulting explosion saw Diamond permanently stripped of his powers.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>Triphammer was apparently able to reconstruct the power drainer and license it to the law enforcement community.\u00a0<br\/><h3>Who Killed Retro Girl?\u00a0<\/h3>Years later, Retro Girl was murdered. Red metal paint found under her fingernails led police to question Triphammer, but it was not just any police. The detective who came to question him was Christian Walker, formerly the superhero Diamond. Triphammer admitted to a sexual relationship with Retro Girl that ended months earlier and was annoyed that Walker and the police were wasting their time questioning him.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>When Walker apprehended the man responsible for Retro Girl's death, it turned out to be just some deluded fan who managed to cobble together a power drainer. He wanted to preserve Retro Girl before society ruined her and wanted to be a part of her life, even if that meant killing her. Rather than allow the man to stand trial and be remembered for what he did, Triphammer stormed the police station and executed him in cold blood. He then went fugitive and disappeared from the eyes of the law.\u00a0<br\/><h3>Super Group\u00a0<\/h3>Triphammer later reappeared after Zora had died and Walker's life was in ruins after he went on television to expose the federal government's attempt to cover up the situation that had gotten Zora killed. He surprised Walker at the grave site for both Retro Girl and Zora, looking different due the plastic surgery he had undergone in order to not be recognized by the public or law. He revealed that he had been visiting Retro Girl's memorial regularly to clean the graffiti off of it and said that he would give Walker money to cover all of the lawsuits and then some. Walker tried to refuse it, but Triphammer was adamant. They were all almost family once, and that family kept getting smaller.\u00a0<br\/><h3>The 25 Coolest Dead Super-Heroes of All Time\u00a0<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1928145-triphammer04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1928145\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.94615384615385\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1928145-triphammer04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1928145\"><img alt=\"Looking for his daughter\" src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/35127\/1928145-triphammer04.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1928145-triphammer04.jpg 650w, http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/35127\/1928145-triphammer04.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>Looking for his daughter<\/figcaption><\/figure>    When a powers-related virus was wreaking havoc and leading to the deaths of many teenage girls, Triphammer came out of hiding.
