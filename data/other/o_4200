He was created as part of Archie's \"Archie Adventure Series\", before that line was camped up as part of their <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mighty_Comics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mighty Comics<\/a> line. He would actually appear 2 years after <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Fly_(Archie_Comics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Fly<\/a> did.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Jaguar is actually archaeologist Ralph Hardy. While on a dig in Peru, a giant serpent burst forth from the ground and began terrorizing the area. Hardy fled into a ruined temple and found a series of cave drawings depicting the ancient Incas battling the same monster and a mystical belt. The belt had an inscription: \"He who loves the animal kingdom may wear this belt and be transformed into a human jaguar.\" Ralph Hardy put on the belt and became the Jaguar.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As the Jaguar he had all the powers of the animal kingdom. The belt had 2 rocket packs on either side, which gave him the power of flight. As the Jaguar, he wore a red body suit with a pawprint on the chest, jaguar-skin belt and boots and no mask. The Jaguar looked exactly like Ralph Hardy, except that Ralph had a mustache. In many ways, the Jaguar was a copy of the Fly. Magic belt instead of magic ring, powers of the animal kingdom rather than insect kingdom, etc.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Jaguar appeared in 15 issues of <em>The Adventures of the Jaguar<\/em>, as well as backup stories in several other Archie comics (<em>Jughead Jones Comic Digest<\/em> 7; <em>Laugh Comics<\/em> 127, 130, 131, 133, 135, 140-142, 144; <em>Laugh Comics Digest<\/em> 25, 27; <em>Pep Comics<\/em> 150, 152, 157, 159, 168), and would show up in <em>The Adventures of the Fly<\/em> #23. When the \"Archie Adventure Series\" line was cancelled and camped up as Archie's <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mighty_Comics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mighty Comics<\/a> line, The Jaguar only made brief appearances in <em><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mighty_Crusaders\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mighty Crusaders<\/a><\/em> #4 and 5. In #5, The Jaguar would team up with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Mr._Justice_(Archie)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Justice<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Steel_Sterling&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steel Sterling<\/a> as the \"Terrific Three\".<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\"

While the race was powerful and pure-hearted, they wondered what the meaning of life really was, just as we humans do now. After contemplating the question they embarked in a space quest to find the true answer. They found nothing more than pain and suffering, and they went on to commit collective suicide in a lava pit on the moon. In their despair and anguish all their souls came together to create the monster know as Null the Living Darkness, who sought to destroy creation. Right after his birth, which took countless centuries, Null targets the town of Christiansboro, Virginia, which is suffering economic depression. His goal is to destroy all humanity, then move out into space and continue his doctrine of anti-life.<\/p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Defenders<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He torments the citizens of Christiansboro with his supernatural powers, driving almost all of them away, until <a href=\"\/gargoyle\/4005-7114\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7114\"> Gargoyle<\/a>, the former mayor, happens to return with <a href=\"\/hellcat-patsy-walker\/4005-3316\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3316\"> Hellcat<\/a>, <a href=\"\/clea\/4005-2216\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2216\"> Clea<\/a>, <a href=\"\/devil-slayer\/4005-13992\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13992\"> Devil-Slayer<\/a> and <a href=\"\/valkyrie\/4005-6809\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6809\"> Valkyrie<\/a>. Null's powers haunt them all as well, bringing them face to face with their own fears, as well as zombies of Christiansboro's dead. Gargoyle is faced with his own dead family, whom he felt rejected and scorned by, but ultimately regains his self-respect and attacks Null directly.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gargoyle tries to use his life-draining powers agents Null but they have no effect, as Null is anti-life: he has no life to drain. Gargoyle quickly realizes his mistake and reverses his strategy, pouring extra life-force back into Null, thus destroying him. Null's zombies go back to dust, and his ghosts are released back to the netherworld.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Ghost Rider<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However for Null this was a training exercise as he now knew how little he comprehend of life. So his next target is to take possession of a man, and he does so by housing himself in Adam, a bitter man. In Adam body he rampages through Cherry Hills, Illinois, using his new powers to levitate people, shrink them and even overwhelm them with his mind until <a href=\"\/johnny-blaze\/4005-6108\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6108\">Ghost Rider <\/a>shows up. They battle back and forth, and eventually Adam is about to crush his wife.  Realizing that he loves his wife after all, Adam regains a bit of control over himself, and Ghost Rider is able to take advantage of Null's weakness, and defeats him.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Squadron Supreme<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Null later finds a pawn in the form of the <a href=\"\/overmind\/4005-4812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4812\">Overmind<\/a>, who like Null is an aggregate of the minds of an entire race.

There, they take over, using President <a href=\"\/nighthawk\/4005-4832\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4832\">Kyle Richmond <\/a>as a cat's-paw. The 616 <a href=\"\/defenders\/4060-26333\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\">Defenders<\/a>, along with six disembodied telepaths that were also from 616 Earth, ultimately intervene. The telepaths use their powers to bring all the Defenders and Squadron members together as one disembodied mind. However, Null is very difficult to defeat; he is able to slowly break a shield made through the combined might of <a href=\"\/doctor-strange\/4005-1456\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr. Strange<\/a>, <a href=\"\/arcanna\/4005-6116\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6116\">Arcanna<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/scarlet-witch\/4005-1466\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch<\/a>; is to easily deflect a full-bore attack by the <a href=\"\/silver-surfer\/4005-2502\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer<\/a>; is able to drain the Overmind's power away from him for his own use; and is even able to successfully battle the combined spiritual power of the Defenders (including mystic and cosmic beings like <a href=\"\/hellstorm\/4005-14695\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14695\">Daimon Hellstrom<\/a>, the Surfer, and Gargoyle) and the Squadron, plus the six telepaths, They ultimately defeat him by making him realize that he has some small amount of good inside, and use it to extinguish him from the inside.<\/p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Null is a mystic life-form created over time by the collective unconscious of members of the extinct race, the S'raphh.

When he first appeared, he was new to his powers and easier to defeat.  When he met Ghost Rider, he was inhabiting a human host and seemed to have less control over his powers.  When he drained power from Overmind, his power was amplified beyond its norm.<\/p><h3>Weaknesses<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Null is vulnerable to mystical forces controlled by specific beings such as Gargoyle and Ghost Rider.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-21855\/","id":21855,"name":"The Haunting of Christianboro!","issue_number":"103"},"gender":0,"id":32507,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/3259661-null.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/3259661-null.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/3259661-null.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/3259661-null.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/3259661-null.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/3259661-null.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/3259661-null.jpg"},"name":"Null the Living Darkness","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-7\/","id":7,"name":"God\/Eternal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/null-the-living-darkness\/4005-32507\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-32556\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":1,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:33","date_last_updated":"2011-05-05 16:54:13","deck":null,"description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-93536\/","id":93536,"name":"\"Porker Fried Rice\" or \"Chung King of the Road\"; Croak & Badger","issue_number":"16"},"gender":0,"id":32556,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/1255273-badger__earth_8311_.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/1255273-badger__earth_8311_.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/1255273-badger__earth_8311_.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/1255273-badger__earth_8311_.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/1255273-badger__earth_8311_.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/1255273-badger__earth_8311_.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/1255273-badger__earth_8311_.jpg"},"name":"Badger","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/badger\/4005-32556\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-32565\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":14,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:14","date_last_updated":"2013-01-23 02:59:36","deck":"Shaft is a ninja member of the Chaste.","description":"<p>Shaft is a ninja member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55828\" href=\"\/chaste\/4060-55828\/\" slug=\"chaste\"> Chaste<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11018\" href=\"\/stick\/4005-11018\/\" slug=\"stick\"> Stick's <\/a>order.

The Celestials first appear in The Eternals #2, and as a concept were created by Jack Kirby. They bare some semblance to Erich von D\u00e4niken's ideas of giant space gods whose tampering with humanity lead to technological advancement. Speaking about his own creations \"The Celestials looked human, didn\u2019t they? They had human form. Underneath those helmets was a human being - a celestial human being, someone godlike in our eyes because of the things he could do that we couldn\u2019t.\"<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><p>Arishem the Judge is a member of the Celestials, Marvel's enigmatic space gods born from the creativity of Jack Kirby. Kirby has cited author Erich von D\u00e4niken and many of his ideas and claims of celestial space gods and aliens that influenced humanity with evidence apparent in ruins of ancient civilizations as inspiration for the Celestials. The Celestials are a staple of Marvel's cosmic landscape but also occasionally appear in such titles as <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/thor\/4005-2268\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/x-men\/4060-3173\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men,<\/a> and who are often mentioned or referenced to in many alien species origin stories or histories. The Celestials most significant plots have naturally occurred in the Eternals series also first created by Jack Kirby. Extremely popular among fans and writers, although they rarely appear, they are written as having engineered various Marvel alien species and even having genetically tampered with early hominid humans to create the sub species the Eternals and the Deviants as well as laying the potential for mutants and the X-Gene to develop in humanity. There has often been speculation about the characters in story origins -with possible origins being explored in an alternative reality- however nothing is as concrete in the mainstream reality concerning the Celestials true origins.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Second Host<\/h3><p>Some time in the past Arishem the Judge conspired against fellow Celestial <a href=\"\/dreaming-celestial\/4005-22836\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\">Tiamut The Communicator,<\/a> who would later one known as the <a href=\"\/dreaming-celestial\/4005-22836\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\">Dreaming Celestial.<\/a> Falsely branding Tiamut a traitor during the Second Host, leader of the Host Arishem the Judge employed fellow Celestials <a href=\"\/eson-the-searcher\/4005-46841\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46841\">Eson the Searcher,<\/a> <a href=\"\/hargen-the-measurer\/4005-46845\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46845\">Hargen the Measurer,<\/a> <a href=\"\/jemiah-the-analyzer\/4005-46844\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46844\">Jemiah the Analyzer,<\/a> and <a href=\"\/tefral-the-surveyor\/4005-46186\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46186\">Tefral the Surveyor<\/a> to strike down Tiamut, their power overwhelming him.

Enormous in stature, up to 2000 feet in height, they possess the ability to manipulate reality, control vast levels of energy and rearrange matter up to an unknown degree They can teleport themselves or vast objects across vast distances. In the rare occurrence that they may be harmed they will regenerate near instantaneously. Capable of withstanding earth shattering blows and greater, easily withstand nuclear bomb level blasts and explosions. Celestials also possess the ability to generate energy blasts that are of an earth shattering level and higher. There is an unknown connection between the Celestials and Hyperspace. It is possible that Hyperspace is the origin of the Celestials vast powers. Arishem the Judge holds a high position of authority among the Celestials, having lead the the Celestial Hosts on Earth. Presumably this may mean he holds more power. Arishem the Judge presides judges and rules over a planet, deciding its fate.<\/p><p><b>Physical Characteristics<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Height: 2000' 0\"<\/li><li>Weight: Varies<\/li><li>Hair: None<\/li><li>Eyes: None<\/li><\/ul><h2>Alternate Versions<\/h2><h3>Earth-9997<\/h3><p>Arishem the Judge appears in this reality.

Gammenon the Gatherer would be the first Celestial to touch down on Earth somewhere near New York, followed by Arishem himself. Apocalypse had kidnapped Cyclops child Christopher Summers and X-Factor followed suit before finding out that the child was the key to curbing the Celestials potential wroth against Earth.

Iron Fist and Luke Cage entered the dojo with the possessed students. Iron Fist was forced to kneel before Cheng as his chi was began to drain.

Nadine didn't want the father of her child to be a killer so Cheng momentarily paused his attack. Cheng flung Nadine across the room which allowed Iron Fist to recover. Iron Fist would dampened his chi powers by using pure rage and decapitate Cheng with one powerful blow.
