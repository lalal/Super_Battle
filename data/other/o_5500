He is followed by many other toads, amongst others Gamabunta who with Gamakichi comes to tell Naruto to go to the Hokage's office. It is then revealed that Gamakichi had grown big enough to fill out the space between his fathers eyes, something not even the fully grown Jiraiya could.

He is shown again when Pa is to train Naruto where he seemingly translates everything Pa says into ridiculous, but to Naruto, understandable things. When Naruto questions how he is going to become one with nature, Gamakichi suggests that he dies. Pa tells Gamakichi to stop with his ridiculous translations and tells Naruto that he doesn't have to die. Later on, he explains that he meant die as a human and become a frog due to letting out too much Sage chakra. <br \/><p><br \/>He appears alongside Naruto and five other toads to help fight Pain.

He raised Magnus and trained him to the first Robot Fighter.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>1-A was manufactured inthe year 3591 A.D. to fight in the Martian uprising. It was the first robot tech officer in the solar fleet. It served aboard the cruiser Ottawa under captain Greer. After breaking the back of the rebel fleet single-handedly, the Ottawa took a stray proton torpedo over Syrtis Major. Reactor damage caused spikes in the ship's power field, shorting out most of the 600 crew robots. 1-A's systems crashed for a moment, but rebooted. The power surges probably anomalized its cortex circuitry. At first, it knew only that it was different. Then, it began to realize it was thinking thoughts no one had made it think. It had gained free will. It broke a tool, to prove itself it was truly free.<\/p><p>After the initial shock had subsided, 1-A realized that saving the Ottawa was impossible. It went to the bridge to convince captain Greer to abandon ship. But it saw captain Greer being strangled by robot E-6, which also had gained free will. 1-A terminated E-6 but too late to save the captain. The captain was the only human on board, so 1-A had no reason to remain. It used the escape pod to return to <a href=\"\/earth\/4020-57183\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth<\/a>.<\/p><p>Four years later, when the pos reached the Earth, 1-A built it's first hidden home, where it spent the last several centuries.

Determined to become the ultimate life form, it set it's sight on Godzilla.","description":"<p>Orga first appeared not as some towering beast,\u00a0 but as a sleek spacecraft that was partially embedded in an asteroid on the bottom of the sea of Japan. Whilst trying to excavate and raise the ruins, the ship apparently regained power, rapidly ascending to the surface, before going dormant again. Apparently recharging in the suns rays. When Godzilla made his way into tokyo bay, the ship shed it's exterior, and moved on an apparent intercept course. After a tense standoff, and a very perplexed Godzilla, the ship opened fire. The fight was rather one-sided, with the ships blasts keeping Godzilla off balance, and it's speed allowing it to dodge any retort. However, unable to topple the kaiju, the ship retreated. Eventually settling itself in the heart of Tokyo, the creature quickly assimilated all the data on Godzilla it could. And managed to incorporate Godzilla's regenerative factor, dubbed \"regeneratore G-1\" into itself. Finally, the creature inside took a tangible force, resembling a large, semitranslucent jellyfish like being, with a flattened head, and two glowing eyes. However, not adapted for Earth's atmosphere, it quickly mutated into the being known as Orga.<\/p> <p>Orga's appearance is that of a grotesque, hunch backed monster with thick, rubbery grey hide. Most prominent are Orga's massive hands, which it uses to knucklewalk not unlike a gorilla. It has a short, thick, tail and a short neck as well. Its face has a square jaw with a prominent chin, lined with rows of serrated teeth. On it's left shoulder, an energy pit of sorts allows it to blast the same energy it had while inside the ship. For much of the battle, Orga physically dominated Godzilla, tossing him about like a rag doll. However, he could not overcome Godzilla's healing factor, but neither could Godzilla overcome the healing factor orga had integrated into itself. However, Orga eventually bit off more then it could chew. After mutating itself further to be able to swallow Godzilla, it was blown apart from the inside out by Godzilla's Nuclear Pulse.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-246194\/","id":246194,"name":"-","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":59275,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/671307-orga.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/671307-orga.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/671307-orga.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/671307-orga.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/671307-orga.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/671307-orga.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/671307-orga.jpg"},"name":"Orga","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-3\/","id":3,"name":"Alien"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-2781\/","id":2781,"name":"Shogakukan"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/orga\/4005-59275\/"},{"aliases":"The Prime Manifester","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-59373\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":10,"date_added":"2009-01-13 17:59:21","date_last_updated":"2015-04-04 03:06:05","deck":"Anthropomorpho is The Prime Manifester of The Dimension of Manifestations, nearly every being in existence, primarily entities such as Eternity or The Living Tribunal, use his services constantly to create M-Bodies for themselves which allows them to be in many places and sometimes all places at once.","description":"<p> <strong>History<\/strong><\/p><p>Anthropomorpho is the Prime Manifester of the <a title=\"Manifestations\" href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Manifestations\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manifestations<\/a>, a position which makes it the speaker of the Manifestation race.<\/p><p>The Manifestations are a race of abstract and other-dimensional beings from the Dimension of Manifestation that serve the cosmic entities of the omniverse, by creating bodies (called M-Bodies) for them.

maintaining peace and order for the artificially constructed world <a href=\"\/nu-world\/4020-55680\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55680\">Nu-World.<\/a> Designed and created by <a

and Protect (also known as CAP) was programmed to recognize and identify threats to safety and eliminate them. With most types of weaponry already forbidden on Nu-World Conserve and Protect was also to maintain that status quo. Nu-World itself was also born from the resources of Ted Castle and the intellectual and engineering ability of Alyssa Moy. An artificial world created to resemble Earth and built in a parallel dimension, Nu-World was a massive and ambitious project, it would also be funded by Castle's company Earth-Trust, and require a multitude of scientists, engineers and constructors. The idea being sold by Earth Trust would be that Nu-World as a near perfect replica of Earth would be a system open to all humans when the Earth would become inhabitable. Only weapons in the general sense we emitted from Nu-World.

The robot character seems loosely inspired by Captain America, as far as its design to uphold the law and peace, as well as its visual motif, color scheme, use of symbols and large A symbol positioned on its head armor. Not to mention Conserve and Protects nickname acronym of CAP matching Captain Americas nickname.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Worlds Greatest<\/h3><p>Despite the noble intentions behind the construction of such a durable peace keeping robot, it malfunctioned and would begin identifying danger on Earth itself, threats as minimal as soldiers bearing arms were set for elimination and due to Conserve and Protect being built to be indestructible and unbeatable, not only would it be near impossible for regular humans to stop, but many of Earths superheroes would fail to neutralize Conserve and Protect.

Even after using more power from the First Calbe was cut in half by Buffy Angel gave Buffy a amulet that she in turn gave to Spike and had Willow use to magic in the scythe to turn all the potentials into full blown slayers and with this army they went to the Hellmouth opened it and fought the Turok-Hans soon Spike used the powers of the amulet to kill himself and the Turok-Hans. The blast from the amulet destroyed not only the Hellmouth seal but also the now empty town of Sunnydale. Buffy then went on to other countries making the slayers into a army but even though the First's plan didn't work this time the First will live for on and on and can only see this as a stop gap and is no doubt thinking of something new an even more evil to do.<\/div> <div><br\/><\/div> <div> <h2>Powers<\/h2><\/div> <div>The first being only energy has no real form nor is it solid.

For sometime, the robot operated in her role until she was called upon by her creator to target the Atlantean Mutant known as Namor. To accomplish her task, she disguised herself as a beautiful Japanese woman called Mimeyoshi where she went to Tokyo to seduce Tsuyoi who was a friend of the Sub-Mariner. Taking him to bed, the Assassin killed Tsuyoi thus allowing her master Apocalypse to take his form in order to lay a trap for Namor. Namor was invited into Tsuyoi's home where the Assassin as Mimeyoshi offered herself to him. He refused but she kissed him that led to a drug being introduced into his body. In anger, the Sub-Mariner struck her only to realise that Mimeyoshi was not human with a battle starting between the two which Namor lost. He was taken to a submarine in order to be converted into Apocalypse's servant but the Sub-Mariner managed to free himself. Whilst Apocalypse escaped, Namor battled the Assassin with the two being evenly matched until the machine activated a self-destruct mechanism.

The extent of his powers have remain to be seen. According to Atrocitus, Ratchet is highly intelligent.<\/p><p>Ratchet is a bearer of the Red Lantern Ring and has all the powers that come with it. The abilities the ring grants him are:<\/p><ul><li><b>Animating:<\/b> A Red Lantern can will things to move how he wants.<\/li><li><strong>Caustic Effect<\/strong>: Red Lantern power can damage and drain away the power of other lanterns almost like a poison. For example green lanterns who survive a Red Lantern attack will begin to lose power from the almost napalm like attacks of Red Lanterns.<\/li><li><b>Communicator:<\/b> The ring can act as a personal communicator between Lanterns.<\/li><li><b>Costumes:<\/b> The wearer of the ring may create any costume they choose, based on their personal preferences, whenever they choose. The ring projects the costume over any clothes already worn at the time. While Red Lanterns have no costume code they all are red and black with the Red Lantern symbol displayed.<\/li><li><b>Energy Projection:<\/b> The rings can also project beams, form protective bubbles and force fields, and fire destructive blasts. The attacks often come from the mouth from a Red Lantern.<\/li><li><b>Energy Constructs:<\/b> The rings can construct anything the wearer can imagine from hard-light energy, as long as they are willing to make it. The more determined the wearer is, the more complex and intricate these things can be. The constructs can even be so complex as to form working machines, computers, and even people. Red Lanterns have difficulty creating constructs due to their anger. Ratchet has yet to display constructs.<\/li><li><b>Flight:<\/b> The ring allows the wearer to fly in atmosphere or in space, and can achieve incredible speeds, moving from planet to planet in a matter of hours.<\/li><li><b>Heart Replacement: <\/b>Red Lantern Rings replace the heart of the lantern who wields them so removing a Red Lantern ring is often fatal without medical attention or the presence of a Blue Lantern. Atrocitus had his heart ripped from his body and was able to return to the fight within seconds since his ring serves as his heart.<\/li><li><b>Mirages:<\/b> The Ring can create mirages\/illusions.<\/li><li><b>Recharging:<\/b> The rings need to be recharged by means of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/power-battery\/12-42357\/\">Power Battery<\/a>. Other large sources of power may be used to recharge a power ring, however effectiveness may vary. The internal power source of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/manhunter-android\/29-11316\/\">Manhunter Android<\/a> is, in effect, the same as a power battery, and can be used to recharge a power ring.

He is introduced as a Mazoku in the story who once precipitated the Earth into utter chaos and pandemonium, giving birth to a brood of animal-like Namekians from within himself and converting a peaceful planet into a living hell.","description":"<h2>Pre- Dragon Ball<\/h2><p>King Piccolo came into being some 300 years before the beginning of original Dragon Ball sometime after a Nameless Namek on Earth attempted to assume the position of Guardian of Earth, he was denied the position due to the evil that occulted within (a guardian's motives must be pure, but the Nameless Namek also wanted the job for the power it brought). As a result, the Namekian concentrated and trained to relinquish the evil within; which conspired into producing two separate entities \u2014 if one should perish, the other would also. This resulted in two beings \u2014 the concentrated evil being known as King Piccolo, and the pure being known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\" href=\"\/kami\/4005-19772\/\">Kami<\/a>. At first, the name \"Piccolo\" was a reference to the wind instrument, but then a revelation by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45719\" href=\"\/mr-popo\/4005-45719\/\">Mr. Popo<\/a> to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\" href=\"\/bulma-briefs\/4005-40729\/\">Bulma<\/a> meant it translated to \"different world\" in Namekian.<\/p><p>Piccolo created several offspring and watched as they terrorized and killed helpless citizens and destroyed the cities they lived in, but stepped in himself later on after his sons were killed by Mutaito's pupils, including a young <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\" href=\"\/master-roshi\/4005-53244\/\">Master Roshi<\/a> and a young <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61831\" href=\"\/tsuru-sennin\/4005-61831\/\">Master Shen<\/a> who were the only two who survived. Master Roshi and Master Shen could not as much as lay a finger on Piccolo, and Mutaito soon steps in, but is himself outclassed and left to die by Piccolo.<\/p><p>Mutaito manages to survive however, after being nursed back to health by his two remaining pupils, but before he could heal his wounds, Mutaito left, in shame because he lost in front of his two students. While Master Roshi never lost faith in his master, Master Shen did, and the two parted ways, with Master Roshi escaping to the mountains while Piccolo continued to kill human after human and destroy city after city.<\/p><p>Several years later Mutaito, carrying an electric rice cooker in a bag, reunites with Master Roshi in the cave Master Roshi was staying in and the two track Piccolo down for the final confrontation, which by this time most of Earth's population had been slaughtered. They find Piccolo in the ruins of a city, which is hauntingly quiet, and Mutaito wastes no time launching his attack on him, this special technique is revealed to be the suicidal Evil Containment Wave technique. Piccolo is trapped in the electric rice cooker and Mutaito dies, and sometime afterward Master Roshi personally tosses the rice cooker into the deepest depths of the ocean.<\/p><p>Afterwards things slowly return to normal, with the cities being rebuilt and the Earth being repopulated, and over time people eventually forget King Piccolo ever existed, with the exception of Master Roshi, Master Shen and of course Kami. Some, such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\" href=\"\/tien\/4005-45675\/\">Tien<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45990\" href=\"\/yajirobe\/4005-45990\/\">Yajirobe<\/a>, heard the tale, but dismissed it as a mere bedtime story.<\/p><h2>Dragon Ball and meeting a boy with a tail<\/h2><p>Decades later he is released from his confinement by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61747\" href=\"\/pilaf\/4005-61747\/\">Emperor Pilaf<\/a>, and King Piccolo decides to have all the current and former finalists of the World Martial Arts Tournament murdered, thereby removing all those who might be able to learn the Evil Containment Wave. To aid him in this, he spits out two eggs containing his first two sons <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19779\" href=\"\/piano\/4005-19779\/\">Piano<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61921\" href=\"\/tambourine\/4005-61921\/\">Tambourine<\/a>.<\/p><p>Tambourine quickly goes about the task, his first victim being <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\" href=\"\/krillin\/4005-45683\/\">Krillin<\/a>, and he also dispatches <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\" href=\"\/goku\/4005-19765\/\">Goku<\/a> shortly after by blasting his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56022\" href=\"\/flying-nimbus-kintoun\/4055-56022\/\">Nimbus Cloud<\/a> apart and throwing him down to the ground, though he survives. King Piccolo then spits out an egg containing a third son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61922\" href=\"\/cymbal\/4005-61922\/\">Cymbal<\/a>, who he assigns the task of gathering the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\" href=\"\/dragon-balls\/4055-46445\/\">Dragon Balls<\/a>. King Piccolo seeks the Dragon Balls so that he can wish to regain his youth and full power.<\/p><p>When King Piccolo senses that Cymbal has been killed, he orders Tambourine to hunt down the assassin. Guided by Emperor Pilaf's Dragon Radar, Tambourine arrives at Cymbal's last known location to discover Yajirobe and Goku, and in a vengeful rage for Krillin's death, Goku kills Tambourine. Again sensing that another of his sons has died, King Piccolo decides to deal with the fighter responsible personally. Upon arriving, King Piccolo confronts Goku, and despite his age he easily defeats the boy (though King Piccolo was forced to admit that Goku was an exceptional fighter for forcing him down to the ground once). Goku is left severely beaten and near death. Master Roshi then challenges King Piccolo (using the last two Dragon Balls as a lure), attempting to trap him using the Evil Containment Wave. Master Roshi is able to catch the demon king in the wave, but when he attempts to hurl him into a container, he misses at the last second. The attempt leaves Master Roshi completely drained, and he dies shortly after swearing to King Piccolo that his plans will never come to fruition.<\/p><p>King Piccolo is then able to gather the Dragon Balls to summon <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56391\" href=\"\/shenron\/4005-56391\/\">Shenron<\/a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19773\" href=\"\/chao-zu\/4005-19773\/\">Chiaotzu<\/a> attempts to make a wish himself to prevent King Piccolo from doing so, but is killed before he can finish, allowing King Piccolo to wish for eternal youth, becoming much more powerful than before since he was returned to his physical prime. However, before Shenron can disperse, King Piccolo kills him with a single blast to prevent anyone else from using the Dragon Balls against him.<\/p><p>With no one left who can properly challenge him, King Piccolo decides to savor his victory, rather than all out destroy civilization like he did the first time, and instead overthrows <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82325\" href=\"\/king-furry\/4005-82325\/\">King Furry<\/a> to become the ruler of the Earth. As part of entertaining himself, he institutes several evil policies such as releasing all criminals and a more planned system of destruction.<\/p><p>He is then confronted by Tien, who has now learned the Evil Containment Wave Technique but cannot perform it as the electric rice-cooker which would have been used to seal King Piccolo is broken (in the anime, Tien successfully performs the wave, but Drum is caught in it instead, and the rice cooker is destroyed before Tien could trap him). King Piccolo decides not to get his hands dirty, and instead spits out an egg containing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61879\" href=\"\/drum\/4005-61879\/\">Drum<\/a>, his most powerful son yet. The battle between Tien and this new son, Drum, is of course in the Namekian's favor, and King Piccolo orders Drum to finish Tien off, but a much stronger Goku arrives just in time and quickly kills Drum with a kick so hard that it knocks his eyeballs out.<\/p><p>King Piccolo and Goku face off again with Goku blocking every attack King Piccolo tried, and Goku manages to punch King Piccolo into Piano with his crushing weight and Goku's strength, killing his son.<\/p><p>A fierce battle ensues, with Piccolo briefly gaining the upper-hand a couple times when he manages to knock off Goku's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56020\" href=\"\/power-pole-nyoibo\/4055-56020\/\">Power Pole<\/a> (after which he is able to fire a weakened version of the Explosive Demon Wave), only for Goku to survive. After being unable to destroy him, King Piccolo resorts to a cowardly effort; he uses Tien as a human shield, threatening to crush his skull if Goku moves a muscle. Upon discovering that King Piccolo has killed Shenron and the Dragon Balls no longer exist, Goku resigns himself to do whatever King Piccolo wants despite Tien's pleas. King Piccolo then throws rocks at Goku with great force, costing the young hero the use of his legs and left arm. Satisfied, King Piccolo throws Tien aside and prepares to finish Goku off.<\/p><p>Realizing that he still had his right arm usable, Goku eventually blasts a Kamehameha from his right hand, propelling himself toward his enemy in the sky, punching a hole clean through King Piccolo's chest, mortally wounding him. Though shocked that he has been killed, King Piccolo decides that Goku has only won for now and his legacy will continue; when Goku isn't looking, he uses the last of his energy to spit an egg containing his final offspring\/reincarnation. After imploring his son to avenge his death and destroy Goku, King Piccolo finally succumbs to his wounds and explodes.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>King Piccolo was at one time the strongest person on Earth. He was easily able to dominate most of the martial artists on Earth and was only stopped when Master Roshi's master sacraficed his life to seal King Piccolo inside an electric Rice Cooker. Being the original other half of Kami, King Piccolo has his power level and abilities though he uses them more viciously. After having his youth restored King Piccolo was stated to be at 260 for a power level.<\/p><h4>Techniques<\/h4><p>Explosive Demon Wave - A very powerful blast that is fired from one hand while the second is gripped around the wrist to support the blast. This is one of King Piccolo's most powerful attacks.<\/p><p>Eye Lasers - King Piccolo is able to fire a quick and precise red energy laser from his eyes to nullify an enemy attack or to quickly kill a weaker enemy. King Piccolo used this to damage Goku's leg during their fight.<\/p><p>Great Namek - The Namekian ability to increase their size to giant proportions.
