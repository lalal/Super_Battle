Their world was defending against an invasion force and despite their technological expertise, the time needed for communication through their neural pathways made their reactions too slow to effectively pilot their own starfighters. Phantos traveled to Earth where it attempted to abduct <a href=\"\/hal-jordan\/4005-11202\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan<\/a>, not realizing Jordan was a member of the star-spanning <a href=\"\/green-lantern-corps\/4060-6992\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps<\/a>. Jordan was test piloting a jet for the <a href=\"\/ferris-air\/4020-55896\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55896\">Ferris Aircraft<\/a> Corporation when Phantos disintegrated the aircraft out from under him. Assuming his attacker had deduced his identity as <a href=\"\/green-lantern\/4015-41148\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\">Green Lantern<\/a>, Jordan changed into costume and defended himself. Phantos' slower reflexes were no match for the Green Lantern. It found itself plummeting to the ground when the ring wielder deprived Phantos of its weapon and means of flight, a high tech wand. The Green Lantern caught Phantos and learned of his attacker's predicament. With Phantos' permission, Green Lantern used the <a href=\"\/green-power-ring\/4055-41361\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">power ring<\/a> to increase the speed of the aliens' neural pathways. Phantos was surprised when Jordan refused to repair his own aircraft which had been destroyed, stating he would not use the power ring for personal gain. Surprised by the Green Lantern's selflessness, Phantos still wanted to express its gratitude. The wand Phantos employed to disintegrate the jet had kept a molecular blueprint which Phantos used to reassemble the aircraft, thereby saving Jordan's job as a test pilot. Once the improved Phantos returned to its homeworld, it was able to repel the invading forces. The unit Phantos sent their best to <a href=\"\/oa\/4020-41360\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\">Oa<\/a> to serve the Green Lantern Corps as a ring wielder until the destruction of the <a href=\"\/central-power-battery\/4055-55704\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\">Central Power Battery<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><ul><li><b>Animating:<\/b> A Green Lantern can will things to move how he wants.<\/li><li><b>Artificial Intelligence:<\/b> Every ring has a connection to the Main Battery on Oa, which taps into an artificial intelligence. It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a Lantern's success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer (though they have difficulty translating profanity), which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Green Lantern ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector. The AI can be used to play a holographic playback sequence complete with colors across the spectrum based on information in memory banks. The ring can dictate when to pause or stop the playback should an interruption arise where the Lanterns undivided attention is needed. The AI can also alert the wielder of incoming threats or of attempts to manipulate the wielders construct by an outside party.<\/li><li><b>Burglar Alarm:<\/b> A Green Lantern can coat anything with the ring's beam and thus, if anyone other than himself touches it, his ring will glow, alerting him to the possible theft.<\/li><li><b>Communicator:<\/b> The ring can act as a personal communicator between Green Lanterns. They have also been seen connected to telephones.<\/li><li><b>Costumes:<\/b> The wearer of the ring may create any costume they choose, based on their personal preferences, whenever they choose. The ring projects the costume over any clothes already worn at the time. The only rules that the Guardians of the Universe implement on the creation of a individual costumed is that the ring bearer display the insignia of the Green Lantern Corps.<\/li><li><b>Energy Projection:<\/b> The rings can also project beams, form protective bubbles and force fields, and fire destructive blasts. Sometimes, depending on the wearer, the beams and blasts make sounds. <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/kilowog\/29-6952\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kilowog<\/a>'s ring is one such example of blasts making sounds.<\/li><li><b>Energy Constructs:<\/b> The rings can construct anything the wearer can imagine from hard-light energy, as long as they are willing to make it. The more determined the wearer is, the more complex and intricate these things can be. The constructs can even be so complex as to form working machines, computers, and even people. However, Hal is known for his relatively simple, straightforward constructs like his ever faithful boxing glove.<\/li><li><b>Flight:<\/b> The ring allows the wearer to fly in atmosphere or in space, and can achieve incredible speeds, moving from planet to planet in a matter of hours.<\/li><li><b>Invisibility:<\/b> The ring can make the wearer or anything else invisible.<\/li><li><b>Matter Manipulation:<\/b> A Green Lantern can use their ring to manipulate nearby matter, such as water, for various purposes such as a construct that acts like an energy construct but can block something yellow and may serve a purpose that an energy construct couldn't perform.<\/li><li><b>Mind Control:<\/b> The wearer of the Ring can use it to plant post hypnotic commands or control a person.<\/li><li><b>Mirages:<\/b> The Ring can create mirages\/illusions.<\/li><li><b>Phasing:<\/b> The ring allows the user to go through walls. This ability however required great concentration on the bearer of the ring<\/li><li><b>Power Absorbing:<\/b> In the JLA's first fight with <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/amazo\/29-3737\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazo<\/a>, it was GL who defeated him by drawing out all of Amazo's powers. In Green Lantern\/ <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/silver-surfer\/29-2502\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silver Surfer<\/a>: Unholy Alliances, Kyle defeated Parallax with SS' power and <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/thanos\/29-7607\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thanos<\/a> with Oa's energy by drawing out all that extra energy from them which made them unconscious. However he couldn't hold all that power nor could his Ring like Hal did with Amazo's powers, so that move isn't often used with so much power.<\/li><li><b>Probing:<\/b> The ring can probe the Lantern's or another person's mind, allowing him to uncover memories or the person's thoughts. <b>(An ability which has not been seen for some time)<\/b><\/li><li><b>Recharging:<\/b> The rings need to be recharged by means of a<a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/power-battery\/12-42357\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Power Battery<\/a>. Other large sources of power may be used to recharge a power ring, however effectiveness may vary. The internal power source of a <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/manhunter-android\/29-11316\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manhunter Android<\/a> is, in effect, the same as a power battery, and can be used to recharge a power ring. During the <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/jla-avengers\/49-10941\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JLA \/ Avengers<\/a> crossover, a <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/cosmic-cube\/18-40949\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Cube <\/a>was used to recharge a depleted ring, although this is not an ideal solution and is available if there are no other options.<\/li><li><b>Ring Duplication:<\/b> Each ring can duplicate itself, creating a second ring which may be given to another as a backup, for protection, or to help the lantern in times of great need. This duplicate ring is exactly like a normal ring.<\/li><li><b>Temperature Control:<\/b> The Ring can increase or decrease the temperature of anything, even something as large as stars, or even create bubbles of intense heat or cold, even down to Absolute Zero. This could be seen in the recent Sinestro Corps War when Sallak used his ring to incase an enemy in a force bubble an incinerate him.<\/li><li><b>Transforming (former):<\/b> The ring can transform anyone or anything, be it into an animal, altering their state of appearance, or their size. Once Hal and Alan turned the two Flashes (<a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/barry-allen\/29-22804\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barry <\/a>and <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/jay-garrick\/29-2395\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jay<\/a>) to light protons in order to free them from prisons.<\/li><li><b>Electro-magnetic scanning:<\/b> The ring can allow(through the use of x rays) the user to see through walls, without the people on the other side knowing. it can also scan along the Electromagnetic spectrum.<\/li><li><b>Wormhole\/Warps:<\/b> The ring can open wormholes to cut down on distance.<\/li><li><b>Healing:<\/b> A wielder can command a ring to heal him\/her\/itself of any injures incurred. It can also heal others. This ability however cannot regenerate lost limbs.<\/li><li><b>Energy twin:<\/b> The ring can create an energy copy of the wielder which is connected to the ring wielder, any information the twin gathers is transferred to the wielder upon touch while others cannot see this twin apart from fellow Green Lanterns.<b>(An ability which has not been seen for some time)<\/b><\/li><li><b>Pocket dimension<\/b>: Within the ring is a pocket dimension which can altered to the wielders specification. It can be used to contain opponents.<\/li><li><b>Sub-routines:<\/b> The power rings have inner programmings or mechanisms which can executed without the users permission.

It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a \"Sinestro's\" success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer, which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Sinestro Corps ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector, someone capable of instilling great fear.<\/li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\"><b>Communicator:<\/b><b> <\/b><b> <\/b> The ring can act as a personal communicator between Sinestro Lanterns.

The White Rabbit's neat-freak maid whom her boss initially mistook Alice for because of her pinafore and human appearance, even though Mary-Ann's hair is short and black and she is quite possibly a short adult. Mary-Ann is quite poor. She is happiest when scrubbing something within an inch of it's life and abhors filth. She is somewhat like Adrian Monk (from USA Network's tv show, <i>Monk<\/i>) in that aspect. She lives in a tiny hut in the Slowsand Lands, under a teetering boulder on a ledge that is more than twice the size of her house. Her closest friends are her talking feather duster and her boss. Her worst friend is the Cheshire Cat, who causes an endless sea of trouble for her. The comic later suggests that she and Alice may be the same person, but that they cannot exist in the same realm at the same time, as Alice only appears when Mary-Ann falls asleep. Mary-Ann doesn't really have any dreams or ambitions and is unsure of her own loyalties, but when her boss is threatened with death by the Queen of Hearts, she takes him on a journey to find out about the \"Alice Monster\" in hopes of clearing his name. Instead, they discover the missing Queen of Spades, the Alice Cult, and a couple of conspiracies. The Alice Cult notices the similarities between Mary-Ann and Alice, and ask her to lead their rebellion, but she refuses. After the Queen of Spades confronts the Queen of Hearts, she reveals her treachery in disposing of the Diamond and Club queens. Mary-Ann receives a gift from Alice and uses it to cut both queens down. The throne is open, but she rejects the crown, so the Cheshire Cat steps in and quickly turns Wonderland upside-down, until the Duchess steps in. In the end, the castle is gone and Wonderland is in a peaceful state of anarchy. Whether the White Rabbit lost his house to the Heart Card Guards or the Cream Flood, Mary-Ann takes him into her hut, despite the 6 tons of potential doom teetering over their heads. <\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-116038\/","id":116038,"name":null,"issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":57999,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/576682-marry_ann.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/576682-marry_ann.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/576682-marry_ann.png","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/576682-marry_ann.png","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/576682-marry_ann.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/576682-marry_ann.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/576682-marry_ann.png"},"name":"Mary-Ann","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-383\/","id":383,"name":"SLG Publishing"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/mary-ann\/4005-57999\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-58110\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":1,"date_added":"2008-10-19 23:39:49","date_last_updated":"2012-02-05 17:27:02","deck":"One of the Ruined","description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-45987\/","id":45987,"name":"\"...Itza Been Ruined!\"","issue_number":"20"},"gender":0,"id":58110,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/588915-200px_katar__28earth_616_29.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/588915-200px_katar__28earth_616_29.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/588915-200px_katar__28earth_616_29.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/588915-200px_katar__28earth_616_29.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/588915-200px_katar__28earth_616_29.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/588915-200px_katar__28earth_616_29.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/588915-200px_katar__28earth_616_29.jpg"},"name":"Katar of the Bloody Blades","origin":null,"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/katar-of-the-bloody-blades\/4005-58110\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-58143\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":7,"date_added":"2008-10-21 13:22:04","date_last_updated":"2013-06-06 12:38:13","deck":"Originating as data from Mr. Fantastic\u2019s inter-dimensional notepad, Modulus was inadvertently given sentience and mobility when Franklin Richards played with the pad.","description":"<p>Seeking to unite with Mr. Fantastic as an \u201cequal,\u201d Modulus targeted other members of the Fantastic Four and anything else that got in his way.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-139076\/","id":139076,"name":"Sentient Part 1","issue_number":"62"},"gender":0,"id":58143,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/591786-modulus.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/591786-modulus.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/591786-modulus.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/591786-modulus.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/591786-modulus.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/591786-modulus.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/591786-modulus.jpg"},"name":"Modulus","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-9\/","id":9,"name":"Other"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/modulus\/4005-58143\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-58206\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":1,"date_added":"2008-10-23 01:31:50","date_last_updated":"2015-07-06 01:21:08","deck":"The T-1000000 (Terminator One Million) is the most advanced Terminator at Skynet's disposal.

He met both Sly and Bentley when the three of them were growing up in the Orphanage. Murray's driving skill came from his job as a pizza delivery boy, during which he hotwired cars and was eventually fired for dropping too many pizzas.<\/p><p>Murray is quite large and has an enormous appetite. He is depicted as a weakling in the first game, and unbelievably strong in the second game. Murray is by far the strongest of the Cooper trio, and arguably is also the most battle ready of the three. Murray is also known for saying some of the series' most hilarious lines (i.e. \"Another barrier stands before you. Fear not, I shall bend it like the truth!\") and having a peculiarly strong love of his Van, the team's getaway vehicle (he cried after it floated away in Sly 2 and was unstoppable in his quest to bring it back in Sly 3), having worked on it, throughout his life. Murray throughout the games wears a blue t-shirt that looks a bit too small for him, and a light blue scarf to go with his driver motif and no pants. In the second game and on Murray dons a marroon mask over his head and matching fighting gloves over his hands when donning his \"The Murray\" persona in battle. Murray also appears to wear thick rim glasses...although they could also be goggles or perhaps a strange hybrid of the two. Goggles would certainly go with his driver motif and he shows in Sly 3 that he doesn't really need glasses like Bentley does.<\/p><p>Murray seemed more chubby and laid back in Sly 1 and although still rotund by the second game and on, looked considerably tougher and a bit more muscular. Murray is officially listed as being 20 years old during the first game, and since the second takes place two years after Murray would be 22 by the time of <i>Sly 2<\/i> and 23 by the time of the third game.<\/p><p>Although he is generally a very nice guy, Murray has shown that he has quite a bit of repressed anger. Whether this is due to his experiences in the orphanage or something else is never explored in any of the games. This is highlighted during Episode 4 of Sly 2, where the Contessa points this out. This is also evident by his violent outbursts when any of his friends are harmed, and could also be a reason for his decision to leave the team due to feeling responsible for Bentley's injury at the end of Sly 2. Although this is quelled seemingly by Sly 3 due to his time with the aboriginal Guru, Murray still seems quite comfortable with his hot-blooded inner rage when he needs it.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-247000\/","id":247000,"name":"Adventures of Sly Cooper","issue_number":"2"},"gender":0,"id":58451,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/632468-screenshot_sly2_09.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/632468-screenshot_sly2_09.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/632468-screenshot_sly2_09.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/632468-screenshot_sly2_09.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/632468-screenshot_sly2_09.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/632468-screenshot_sly2_09.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/632468-screenshot_sly2_09.jpg"},"name":"Murray","origin":null,"publisher":null,"real_name":"Willy \"Murray\" Hippopotamus","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/murray\/4005-58451\/"},{"aliases":"Fulgore X150\nBlack Eagle","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-58455\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":7,"date_added":"2008-11-12 17:36:20","date_last_updated":"2017-01-09 15:31:51","deck":"A highly advanced assault cyborg created by Ultratech to be the deadliest piece of military machinery ever made.

His design seems to be heavily based off of an old English <a href=\"\/knights\/4015-56092\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56092\">Knight<\/a>. His head and face resemble that of a knight's helmet and mask, his red eyes slanted into a death glare and no nose or mouth, though he seems to be able to make grunts and screeches. One of the most dominant \"knight\" appearances is the feather-like extension protruding from the back of his head, as seen with most knight's helmets with feathers. The rest of his body is humanoid, having random circuitry and electrical tubing coming out of his neck and torso that powers his massive strength and intelligence.<\/p><p>Fulgore receives a slight design overhaul in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/killer-instinct-2\/3030-21952\/\">Killer Instinct 2<\/a>\/<a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/killer-instinct-gold\/3030-10614\/\">Gold<\/a> as the Type-02 is activated. He retains a mostly similar, physical design, though he's slightly more sleek and slim, his armor appearing much sharper and polished, with streaks of metallic blue lining his arms, torso and legs. Yellow highlights and designs are also present on his chest. His metallic blades are now comprised of energy rather than metal. This is to show this Fulgore is a new, improved model over the original.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/105264\/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3879448\" data-ratio=\"1.8461538461538\" data-width=\"650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:184.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/105264\/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3879448\"><img alt=\"Fulgore Artwork (2013)\" src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/105264\/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/105264\/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.png 650w, http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/105264\/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.jpg 520w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/105264\/3879448-2147587230-Fulgo.jpg 346w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" data-width=\"346\"><\/a><figcaption>Fulgore Artwork (2013)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Fulgore again receives a strong overhaul to his design in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/killer-instinct\/3030-42896\/\">Killer Instinct (2013)<\/a> as the formidable Type-03. His face is sleeker and more menacing, but mostly appears virtually identical to past versions. His body appears much more mechanical than the previous incarnations - joints, gears, circuitry, wires, and tubes are exposed along his entire body and back of his limbs. His mass is also distributed in an even more drastic manner, having thinner legs and a larger chest and arms. When his chest plates open, his orange, nuclear reactor core and a stamp that reads \"Mark 03\" are revealed. His plasma blades are also much longer and sharper in design, made more for stabbing this time than slashing.<\/p><h2>History<\/h2><h3>Killer Instinct<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38919\/968918-fulgore_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968918\" data-ratio=\"1.2830188679245\" data-width=\"265\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 265px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38919\/968918-fulgore_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968918\"><img alt=\"Type-01 model\" src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38919\/968918-fulgore_5.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38919\/968918-fulgore_5.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\" data-width=\"265\"><\/a><figcaption>Type-01 model<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A prototype cybernetic soldier developed by <a href=\"\/ultratech\/4060-62030\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-62030\">Ultratech<\/a>, Fulgore was entered into the Killer Instinct tournament as a final test of its combat capabilities. Once its abilities are proven, mass production will begin. One of Ultratech's latest creations and possibly the most dangerous to date, Fulgore is the first in a planned series of cybersoldiers boasting state-of-the-art armouries, worked at feverishly over the last few years by a particularly erratic Ultratech genius and his team of Asian engineers. Dark rumors abound as to where the prototype's human parts originated - the kind of rumors nobody dares voice. The rumors say the human parts originated from a human organ harvesting operation based in Moscow. Before the Fulgore Mk.I model is even finished, the scientists are already working on an upgrade: and to prove the prototype's ultimate worth, it is entered into the tournament with orders to destroy all opposition.<\/p><h3>Ending<\/h3><p>The combat test of the Fulgore series assault cyborg has been a success.
