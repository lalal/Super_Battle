More and more, Hulk's guidance to never stop making them pay was becoming his primary source of thought.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167513-132253-miek.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-167513\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.0275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167513-132253-miek.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-167513\"><img alt=\"King Miek\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167513-132253-miek.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167513-132253-miek.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"King Miek\" src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167513-132253-miek.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167513-132253-miek.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>King Miek<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>To this end, Miek entered into a fifth stage of evolution that was rare for any Native to reac, but he did so because he hive called on him to. When he emerged from his cocoon, he was many times larger and more powerful than before. He was now King Miek, the official leader of his hive. He convinced Hulk that they had to overthrow the Red King. The Red King had to pay for all his crimes, including sending the Spikes, a parasitic alien horde, after them.<\/p><p>Miek soon found a Native queen being held in another Imperial settlement, where her eggs were being used as a food source for the Imperials. He freed her as the Spikes began attacking the settlement, and she was wounded. They all hoped the wound was not severe. Unfortunately, it was severe enough for her to be infected. She transformed into a Spike, forcing Miek to kill her.<\/p><p>As far as Miek knew, he had just killed the last of the Native queens, which meant there was no future for his people. All he and his hive had left was his revenge on the Red King. Their revolution was a success with the Hulk defeating the Red King and becoming king himself. The process of rebuilding began, but it was not enough for Miek. There could be no rebuilding for the Natives. Their queen was dead. Miek and No-Name became close, and she tried to become his new queen to no avail. Miek felt no place in the peace Hulk was creating on Sakaar, so he ended it. In secret, he rigged the warp core explosion of the shuttle that originally brought Hulk to Sakaar, framing the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\" href=\"\/illuminati\/4060-40421\/\"> Illuminati<\/a> for the devastating destruction that explosion brought to the planet. It even claimed the life of Caiera. Now, Hulk's queen was dead too. The Warbound boarded the great stone ship of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57495\" href=\"\/shadows\/4060-57495\/\"> Shadow People<\/a> and headed for Earth, resuming the quest for payback as Miek wanted.<\/p><h3>World War Hulk<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167526-106551-miek.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-167526\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.7425\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167526-106551-miek.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-167526\"><img alt=\"Miek in flight\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167526-106551-miek.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167526-106551-miek.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Miek in flight\" src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167526-106551-miek.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/167526-106551-miek.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Miek in flight<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><b>For further details:<\/b> <a data-ref-id=\"4045-42294\" href=\"\/world-war-hulk\/4045-42294\/\"> World War Hulk<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55657\" href=\"\/world-war-hulk-aftersmash\/4045-55657\/\"> World War Hulk: Aftersmash<\/a><\/p><p>Miek's scheme worked. The Warbound arrived at Earth, defeated the Illuminati and devastated Manhattan on a quest for vengeance that was not truly deserved. Miek wanted to Hulk to be the Worldbreaker and destroy everything so that what comes next could begin. But Hulk stopped short of doing so. After defeating the Sentry, Hulk became Bruce Banner before Miek's eyes. Miek could not understand who this puny human was and wanted the Hulk back, so he lunged at Banner with his spear. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\" href=\"\/rick-jones\/4005-2248\/\"> Rick Jones<\/a> pushed Banner clear and was impaled on Miek's spear instead.<\/p><p>Still, it had the effect Miek desired. Enraged, Banner transformed back into the Hulk and brutally attacked Miek. The Warbound could not get Hulk to stop beating Miek to near death. His hard shell was destroyed, and his body broken and mangled. The truth was that he wanted to die, though. He wanted Hulk to destroy him along with everything else, and he confessed to being responsible for the explosion on Sakaar. This was enough to push Hulk over the edge, and No-Name tried to finish Miek off for all the deaths on Sakaar. After Hulk was finally stopped, Miek survived his brutal beating due to being taken into <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"\/shield\/4060-3775\/\"> S.H.I.E.L.D.<\/a> custody and given medical attention.

This allowed him to lay clutches of eggs, but the hatchlings could not survive long after birthing. Miek found his way to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\" href=\"\/savage-land\/4020-21766\/\"> Savage Land<\/a>, and in the process of asserting himself there, he slaughtered 43 Sakaarian refugees residing there. He had also grown considerably larger and more powerful through this time. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3558\" href=\"\/ka-zar\/4005-3558\/\"> Ka-Zar<\/a> contacted Hulk regarding the deaths of the Sakaarians, and Hulk ssembled his Warbound and headed there directly, despite his grievous injuries he'd sustained from his battle with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\" href=\"\/zeus\/4005-10226\/\"> Zeus<\/a>. During the Warbound's first night there, the Sakaarian elder had drugged the group, allowing Miek and his insect horde to abduct the Hulk. The elder had made an agreement with Miek that his people would be spared if he helped Miek obtain the Hulk as a sacrifice.<\/p><p>Miek had attempted to supplant his hatchlings into the bodies of Sakaarians, to keep them fed and safe, but that had not worked. When he attempted it with the Hulk's unconscious body, the hatchlings thrived. Using exceedingly strong insect chemicals, Miek kept the Hulk drugged and under mind control while his hatchlings gestated in Hulk's chest. He even sent the mind-controlled Hulk against his own Warbound in an attempt to stop them from rescuing his captive. When the Hulk's rage burned off the mind control, Miek tried to convince the Warbound to help him keep his hatchlings alive.<\/p><p>Hulk then tore the infants from his chest and attempted to stomp them, before he set about killing Miek. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48518\" href=\"\/skaar\/4005-48518\/\"> Skaar<\/a> then tackled Hulk, smashing his head into the ground, and calling him a \u2018stupid monster\u2019. Skaar promised the infant insects that no one would hurt them and that he\u2019d care for them, as he could sympathize with their plight. Miek attempted to drug Skaar, to make him kill his father, only to have another of his arms chopped off by Hulk, before he punched Miek through a volcano and across the Savage Land, into a mountain of ice. Hulk chased after, and tried to save Miek, but Miek would not let him, and fell, presumably to his death.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><p>Miek is a member of an insectoid species that is native to Sakaar. They are typically short (shorter than a normal human) and thin, bipedal, and have four arms and an armored exoskeleton. After changing into King Miek, Miek became much larger and thicker (comparable to the size of the Hulk or <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43225\" href=\"\/korg\/4005-43225\/\"> Korg<\/a>). He is much stronger than before and his armor is also much thicker and more durable, able to withstand blows from the Hulk. He could be comparable to a giant cockroach in that aspect.<\/p><p>Like other members of his race, Miek possesses a low level form of telepathy which he can use to communicate to other members of his species sharing common memories and experiences (a process known as chemming). This ability is not limited only to members of his race, as when he accepted the Warbound as members of his hive they were able to become involved in the chemming process once Miek initiated it. When this happens they are drawn into the chemming without necessarily consenting to it.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-108947\/","id":108947,"name":"Planet Hulk: Exile, Part 1 of 4","issue_number":"92"},"gender":0,"id":43226,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/167510-94805-miek.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/167510-94805-miek.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/167510-94805-miek.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/167510-94805-miek.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/167510-94805-miek.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/167510-94805-miek.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/167510-94805-miek.jpg"},"name":"Miek","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-3\/","id":3,"name":"Alien"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":"Miek","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/miek\/4005-43226\/"},{"aliases":"Marius, Nicole, Claudette St. Croix\nEmplate\nM Twins","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-43524\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":25,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:25","date_last_updated":"2016-10-02 13:27:08","deck":"M-Plate is an androgynous amalgamation of the St. Croix siblings, including but not limited to Marius St. Croix, better known as Emplate.","description":"<p>M-Plate is an amalgamated being composed of <a href=\"\/emplate\/4005-10579\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10579\">Emplate <\/a>and the <a href=\"\/m-twins\/4005-41270\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41270\">M Twins<\/a>.<\/p><p>Although, the M Twins had already amalgamated into <a href=\"\/m\/4005-40460\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40460\">M<\/a>, so that's what any mentions on another website or this one of M-Plate being \"Emplate and M fused into one\" mean.<\/p><p>Having been made from so many powerful mutants, M-Plate's power was thought to be unsurpassed, while M-Plate was alive.

The character can often present problems to readers in the sense that meta layers can be interjected with the character on various occasions, subtle references to past writers and creators, and its often very ambiguous and vague nature. <a href=\"\/mark-waid\/4040-40724\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40724\">Mark Waid's<\/a> Fantastic Four run had an appearance of the character, and he cites <a href=\"\/tom-peyer\/4040-42589\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42589\">Tom Peyer<\/a> as the person who suggested The One-Above-All could be represented by a comic artist, specifically Jack Kirby. Writer and artist of the issue didn't want to be too specific though as to not put off casual readers or be too \"in-jokey\" and they managed to sneak in a cigar in an ashtray circumventing Marvel's policy of having no characters smoking but also recognize Kirby who was often told to have a cigar on him.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><p>The One-Above-All is Omnipotent (All Powerful), Omniscient (All Knowing), and Omnipresent (Everywhere). He is the most powerful being in the Marvel Multiverse. His power is unlimited, incalculable and immeasurable. His strength is unlimited, he cannot be damaged in any way and he has control over all forms of energy. Because he is Omnipotent, he wields every power.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-16253\/","id":16253,"name":"Planet Earth is No More!","issue_number":"13"},"gender":0,"id":44473,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/459542-oneaboveallgod23344.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/459542-oneaboveallgod23344.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/459542-oneaboveallgod23344.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/459542-oneaboveallgod23344.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/459542-oneaboveallgod23344.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/459542-oneaboveallgod23344.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/459542-oneaboveallgod23344.jpg"},"name":"One-Above-All","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-7\/","id":7,"name":"God\/Eternal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":"Unknown","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/one-above-all\/4005-44473\/"},{"aliases":"Vlad Dracula III\r\nVlad the Impaler\r\nVlad Tepes\r\nThe Impaling Prince\r\nCount Dracula\r\nDracula\r\nNosferatu\r\nNo-Life King\r\nKing of Vampires\r\nVampire King\r\nUltimate Vampire\r\nTrue Immortal\r\nThe Count\r\nMonster\r\nBird of Hermes\r\nHellsing's Trump Card","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-44583\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":28,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:38","date_last_updated":"2016-04-04 09:20:55","deck":"Dracula himself, Alucard is Hellsing's number one weapon against the creatures of the night.

After that he asks his master Integra to instruct him what to do next and Integra tells him that it is time to release restraint level 0 (releases all his devoured souls to fight by his side; Father Anderson stating it could've been more than a million of souls). Father Anderson realizes it is now the time to finish the vampire and the battle begins, with him fighting through Alucard's summoned minions. When Father Anderson was close enough Alucard pulls out a large black pistol that he had not used before called the Jackal blowing off Anderson left arm, Anderson is surprised when he does not regenerate straight away. Taunting the priest Anderson goes feral and charges head first into Alucard's familiars using one of his most powerful attacks he is still over run and left for dead.

This time he confronts Alucard and shows him a weapon given to him by Section III Matthew had given him Helena's Nail. Alucard knows what the nail will do and tells not to become a monster like he is. But Anderson stabs himself in the heart with the weapon and with his new powers almost kills Alucard before Seras stops the attacks just long enough for Alucard to regain his strength and after a display of massive power rips the Nail along with Anderson still beating heart out. As he dies, Anderson speaks a few last words of pity to Alucard and passes away, turning to ash.<\/p><h2>The Betrayer of Hellsing<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-735779\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22021\/735779-141461_60602_walter_c_donez_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.23\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22021\/735779-141461_60602_walter_c_donez_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-735779\"><img alt=\"Walter Reborn\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-width=\"520\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22021\/735779-141461_60602_walter_c_donez_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22021\/735779-141461_60602_walter_c_donez_super.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Walter Reborn\" src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22021\/735779-141461_60602_walter_c_donez_super.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22021\/735779-141461_60602_walter_c_donez_super.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" data-width=\"520\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Walter Reborn<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As passes away the young Walter jumps from his place above landing and crushes the remains of under his foot saying that he had become trash now that he was dead.

In the final chapter of Hellsing which occurs 30 years later, a shady figure entered Integra's room unnoticed and tried to bite her neck. Integra, quickly waking up and blasted the figure with a gun. Seras, hearing the commotion, rushed to Integra's room only to be surprised that the shady figure was in fact none other than Alucard. He explained that he was gone and hadn't drank blood for 30 years because he killed all the souls within him leaving except one (possibly Schrodinger's). Integra, said that she would give Alucard blood but noted that she was an old lady now.

Donez, Walter ask Alucard why he has taken such a form and Alucard simply reply\u2019s, \u201cForms mean nothing to me.\u201d In this state the girl looks about nine years old and carries a tommy gun. This is probably due to the fact that the pistols had not been made for him yet, Walter is merely 15 years old and just as dangerous as Alucard.

Alucard displays amazing powers as the young nine year old and she is later seen again near the end of the hellsing Manga\u2019s. It is still unknown why Alucard took this form. But many suspect the Arthur van Hellsing put limits on Alucards powers and this forced Alucard into a smaller body. This argument is later disproved when Alucard at the height of his power takes this from once again when facing the traitor Walter.<\/p><h2>Personality<\/h2><p>Alucard, being an immortal, has little regard for the lives of those he kills. He often fights with extreme cruelty, and could be labeled as a sociopath for his tendencies to torture his opponents. However, he holds a strict moral that only human beings can kill monsters as shown when he was fighting Father Anderson. He said that he'd gladly die fighting a human but quickly show disgust when Father Anderson pierced his heart with the Helena's nail, transforming him to a monster.<\/p><p>He's also very loyal to his master Integra wherein he hesitantly asks his master what to do next and obeys it without complaining.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285919\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6671428571429\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:166.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285919\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" data-width=\"383\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 700w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 383w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 700w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/109250\/2285919-2258687-2242656-alucard1.jpg 383w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" data-width=\"383\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Alucard, like all vampires, requires blood to stay alive. However it is not shown in Hellsing as to wether what would happen if a vampire was not to drink blood. Seras Victoria tried to stay away from blood as much as possible during the first half of the manga and had no adverse effect whatsoever. Also, Alucard survivng 30 years without drinking blood can raise the speculations that Vampires do not require blood to survive but can be only be regarded as a craving. But it is still unclear whether Alucard survived because of his new found power.<\/p><h3>Super Strength<\/h3><p>Alucard can lift far in excess of 10 tons effortlessly. Upper limit unknown.<\/p><h3>Super Speed<\/h3><p>Alucard can move at teleportation-like speeds(faster than the speed of bullets).<\/p><h3>Superhuman Reflexes<\/h3><p>Alucard can catch objects moving at supersonic speeds with ease. He even caught Rip Van winkle's bullet(which traveled at Mach 3.5) and fought father Anderson multiple times to a standstill (both were moving faster than average vampires which usually dodges multiple machine gun fires).<\/p><h3>Superhuman Accuracy<\/h3><p>Alucard is very proficient in using guns. He has perfect aim and has taught Seras Victoria on how to shoot things more than a mile away without missing. He can also fire multiple bullets that does not miss without even looking.<\/p><h3>Super Stamina<\/h3><p>Alucard was never shown to tire and could continue fighting as long as he likes.<\/p><h3>Immortality<\/h3><p>Alucard does not age and as a vampire, he does not die. Also, he cannot be killed by any means necessary as he would only redirect the death to one of the souls he devoured. Father Anderson even said that the reason as to why Alucard can never be truly killed is because of all the souls he devoured. However, it is only a pseudo-immortality as he can probably be finally killed by destroying all the souls he released in Restraint Level 0 and by killing him.<\/p><p>Alucard also stated himself that he will not get weak to sunlight, he only dislikes it.<\/p><h3>Invulnerability<\/h3><p>Regular bullets, temperature extremes, bombs,etc. cannot harm Alucard to any degree. Despite his level of near invulnerability, Holy weapons can harm.<\/p><h3>Healing Factor<\/h3><p>Alucard can heal from any injury instantly without scarring including organs or missing limbs (when harmed by those who can match him in strength or holy weapons) If blown to bits he merely turns into a shadow and reforms.<\/p><h3>Vision Powers<\/h3><p>Alucard, like traditional vampires, possess enhanced sight, such as night vision (Alucard can see clearly in total darkness) and telescopic (can see events happening dozens of miles away as it happens).<\/p><h3>Telepathy<\/h3><p>Alucard can read the mind and communicate with anyone he so desires.<\/p><h3>Telekinesis<\/h3><p>Alucard can move objects with his mind. The upper limit of this power is unknown.<\/p><h3>Invisibility<\/h3><p>Alucard can turn invisible to the naked eye any time he so desires.<\/p><h3>Intangibility<\/h3><p>Alucard is capable of shifting his mass into another dimension, altering his density and thus allowing him to pass through any solid object, or allow solid objects to pass through him. This was shown when Alucard phased through a solid wall during the chapter where Seras Victoria was explaining that she was a vampire to the Wild Geese.<\/p><h3><b>Shapeshifting<\/b><\/h3><p>Alucard can turn into any form he chooses-from being able to turn different human beings to animals to even inanimate objects.<\/p><h3><b>Shadow Manipulation<\/b><\/h3><p>Alucard can turn into a shadowy form, which he can use however he wishes (turning into hellhounds,etc.).<\/p><h3><b>Mind Control<\/b><\/h3><p>Alucard has the ability to control the minds of any human, or vampire, he chooses (meaning he can control more than one mind simultaneously). The extent of this power is unknown.<\/p><h3><b>Sleep Induction<\/b><\/h3><p>Can cause someone to sleep by mere thought.<\/p><h3><b>Hypnosis<\/b><\/h3><p>Can send others into a dream-like state (both human and vampire).<\/p><h3><b>Illusions<\/b><\/h3><p>Can create false images in the minds of others (both human and vampire). As shown when he cast an illusion on Walter (making Alucard look like Luke Valentine).<\/p><h3><b>Bloodsucking<\/b><\/h3><p>Can absorb blood through his clothes or over large distances.<\/p><h3>Memory Absorption<\/h3><p>Can absorb memories through blood.<\/p><h3><b>Soul Devouring<\/b><\/h3><p>Owns the soul of whoever he kills.<\/p><h3>Control Art: System Restriction Level 0<\/h3><p>Alucard calls upon all the souls that he's devoured and summons them on the battle field to do as his bidding. The familiars that he has summoned have been stripped away of free will.<\/p><h3>Omnipresence<\/h3><p>When Alucard drank Schrodinger's blood, he had gained his powers. He can now also be everywhere and nowhere at the same time.<\/p><h3>Combat Experience<\/h3><p>Although Alucard prefers uses his vast supernatural powers to crush his opponents, Alucard has mastered all forms of armed and unarmed combat over his past life of 2,000 years.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902075\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18154\/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.32857142857143\" data-width=\"140\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 140px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:32.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18154\/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902075\"><img alt=\"The Jackal\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" data-width=\"140\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18154\/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18154\/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg 140w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Jackal\" src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18154\/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18154\/902075-b8282a6ba8deac3a.jpg 140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" data-width=\"140\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Jackal<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><b>The Jackal<\/b><\/p><p>A large black pistol made by Walter C.

Alucard only possesses of these, due to the fact that it often kills his opponent in the first few shots, much to Alucard's disdain(he prefers causing them a slow and painful death).<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-251482\/","id":251482,"name":"Vol. 1","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":44583,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/1026327-0alucard2.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/1026327-0alucard2.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/1026327-0alucard2.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/1026327-0alucard2.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/1026327-0alucard2.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/1026327-0alucard2.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/1026327-0alucard2.jpg"},"name":"Alucard","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-9\/","id":9,"name":"Other"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-2814\/","id":2814,"name":"Sh\u014dnen Gah\u014dsha"},"real_name":"Vlad III Dracula","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/alucard\/4005-44583\/"},{"aliases":"Arch-E-5912","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-45067\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":36,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:29","date_last_updated":"2014-05-12 20:40:17","deck":"One of Hulk's Warbound.

When the Sagittarian leader was slain, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32863\" href=\"\/daydra\/4005-32863\/\">     Princess Daydra<\/a> organized a rebellion to assist the Hulk, but their Warlord informed Galaxy Master to prepare itself for their attack. Easily overcoming the rebellion, the Galaxy Master snared Daydra in a tractor beam, planning to feed on her. However, the Hulk revived, leapt into the tractor beam, found himself inside the Galaxy Master, and destroyed a central computer-like brain there, seemingly destroying the Galaxy Master.<br \/>Reforming years later, it found the inert form of the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3489\" href=\"\/abomination\/4005-3489\/\">     Abomination<\/a> in space and made him its servant.\u00a0 The Galaxy Master doubled the Abomination's power and sent him to wipe out all possible opposition on planets before appearing and consuming their inhabitants. <br \/>Daydra organized powerful warriors - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13865\" href=\"\/amphibion\/4005-13865\/\">     Amphibion<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32918\" href=\"\/dark-crawler\/4005-32918\/\">     Dark-Crawler<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56865\" href=\"\/torgo\/4005-56865\/\">     Torgo<\/a>, but even they were unable to stop either the Abomination or the Galaxy Master. Daydra led them to Earth so as to bring the Hulk to their world to stop their enemies. The Hulk, altough initially overpowered by the enhanced Abomination, became mad enough and strong enough to smash him. He then confronted the Galaxy Master and destroyed it from the inside again. However, it's uncertain if anything truly can destroy the Galaxy Master forever.\u00a0 <br \/><\/p><h2>Creation<br \/><\/h2>Galaxy Master was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\" href=\"\/stan-lee\/4040-40467\/\">   Stan Lee<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3439\" href=\"\/herb-trimpe\/4040-3439\/\">  Herb Trimpe<\/a> in 1969 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2406\" href=\"\/the-incredible-hulk\/4050-2406\/\"> The Incredible Hulk<\/a> # 111.<br \/><h2>Powers<\/h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Primordial Energy Blasts<\/li> <li>Can assume any form he desires<\/li> <li>Teleportation<\/li> <li>Can multiply into countless deadly parts<\/li> <li>Can shoot out a bludgeoning barrage of white hot meteors<\/li> <li>Forcefield<\/li> <li>Tractor Beam<\/li> <\/ul>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-9994\/","id":9994,"name":"Shanghaied in Space!","issue_number":"111"},"gender":0,"id":45702,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/3378245-527285-galxmast1%20%282%29.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/3378245-527285-galxmast1%20%282%29.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/3378245-527285-galxmast1%20%282%29.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/3378245-527285-galxmast1%20%282%29.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/3378245-527285-galxmast1%20%282%29.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/3378245-527285-galxmast1%20%282%29.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/3378245-527285-galxmast1%20%282%29.jpg"},"name":"Galaxy Master","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-3\/","id":3,"name":"Alien"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/galaxy-master\/4005-45702\/"},{"aliases":"Billy Cranston\nRocky DeSantos\nJustin Stewart\nT.J.

When Billy was a kid he had taken a trip to the park and stopped at the lake and brought his sail boat with him. After he had set his boat in the lake he decided to try and recreat the whirlpool effect he had recently learned about. Billy stuck his finger in the lake and started to make swirling motions with it. This attracted the attention of a fish. Billy screamed and pulled his finger out of the water a fish was at the end of his finger, the fish had bit him. Billy screamed in terror. It would take billy several years before he overcame his fear of fish. He is brilliant and is a genious with technology. He usually can create machines to help the ranger's situation. He didn't know how to fight when he first became a ranger, but eventually learned and became a good martial artist. Billy stayed with the rangers even after he was no longer a Power Ranger and was like a mentor, creating Zords and Weapons for them.<\/p><p><strong>Cestro<\/strong><\/p><h3>Power Rangers: Zeo<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2224\/157530-130475-blue-power-ranger.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-157530\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"288\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 288px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2224\/157530-130475-blue-power-ranger.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-157530\"><img alt=\"Blue Zeo Ranger\" src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2224\/157530-130475-blue-power-ranger.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2224\/157530-130475-blue-power-ranger.jpg 288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" data-width=\"288\"><\/a><figcaption>Blue Zeo Ranger<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Rocky DeSantos<\/strong><\/p><p>After an attack on The Power Chamber, which utterly destroyed it, The Rangers discovered a secret underground base to<\/p><p>continue their fight to protect humanity.

For centuries, it has always been feared but sought after to be used as a tool for war by countless humans. During its attack on Konohagakure, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the fox into his infant son, Naruto Uzumaki.","description":"<h2>Kyuubi<\/h2><p>The Kyuubi also known as the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, is considered to be one of the most powerful tailed beasts.The Kyuubi is reffered to as an age old disaster, a single swipe of its tail is able to produce tsunamis and level mountains.The Kyuubi attacked villages at random, apparently the Kyuubi had been attracted to places where human malice was high. The Kyuubi attacked the village of konoha twelve years before the start of the series. None of the konoha ninja were able to defeat the beast until <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45927\" href=\"\/fourth-hokage\/4005-45927\/\">Minato Namikaze<\/a>, The Fourth Hokage, arrived. The Fourth sacrificed his life to seal the beast within his new born son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\" href=\"\/naruto-uzumaki\/4005-44238\/\">Naruto Uzumaki<\/a>, using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal. Minato did not completely seal off the fox's <a data-ref-id=\"4015-46239\" href=\"\/chakra\/4015-46239\/\">chakra<\/a>, rather he sealed a portion off, allowing the remaining power to be accessed by Naruto.<\/p><p>Before sealing the Kyuubi away within Naruto's body, The Fourth gave a key to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44511\" href=\"\/jiraiya\/4005-44511\/\">Jiraiya<\/a> to either weaken or srtengthen the seal on the Kyuubi if the need presented itself.<\/p><p>Jiraiya suspects that the Kyuubi's assault on the village was not coincidential and that it may have been summoned by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80827\" href=\"\/madara-uchiha\/4005-80827\/\">Madara Uchiha<\/a>, even though the thought of a single person summoning a beast of that caliber seems to be impossible,the fox seems to know Madara.In an encounter with Sasuke, the Kyuubi states that Sasuke's chakra, like Madara's, is more sinister then its own.The Fox also seems to be familiar with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-50974\" href=\"\/uchiha-clan\/4060-50974\/\">Uchiha clan<\/a>, its relationship with the clan is as of yet, unclear.<\/p><p>The only present indications that Naruto is the nine-tails host is the whiskers which appear on his face and the seal which appears on his stomach when he is generating chakra. Due to the Kyuubis chakra, Naruto is able to heal from wounds and fatigue in a very short amount of time, allowing him an incredible stamina. Naruto does not make use of the Nine-Tails chakra until he learns of its presence within him. Naruto is able to call upon the Kyuubi's Immense chakra to perform jutsus which are considered impossible for a ninja of his rank or stature. Naruto can access the Fox's chakra in two ways, one: he can submit to his rage allowing the Kyuubi's personality to take control making naruto more blood thirsty and violent, or two:he can enter his subconscious mind and ask for the Fox for its strength.In the case of the latter, the Kyuubi is shown to have a loathing respect for Naruto and his father. While the Kyuubi usually grants Naruto his power out of amusement,he also does so to increase his influence upon Naruto. The Kyuubi also acts to preserve its own well-being,as in the case Naruto would die the Kyuubi shall along with him.<\/p><p>As Naruto draws upon the fox's chakra more and more, the Fox begins to manifest itself in the form of chakra generated tails. Naruto can only maintain control over the first three tails, at the fourth tail he loses all rational thought and destroys or attacks anyone or anything nearby. In these cases, the fox's influence can only be supressed by Yamato's Mokuton abilities or by a special seal created by Jiraiya to supress the fox's chakra which is applied to Naruto's body.<\/p><p>In recent invents Itachi has explained to Sasuke that anyone with the Mangekyou Sharigan can take control of the Kyuubi.<\/p><h2>Different Charkra forms of the Kyuubi<\/h2><h3>0 Tail Naruto<\/h3><p>There are two different forms of chakra for 0 tail naruto. The first stage that has been shown is the more bestial stage then the other form. In this form Narutos' whiskers became longer, darker and more noticeable. His nails grow longer. His teeth start growing fangs and become longer. His jaw is widened. All of his previously injuries are healed at a remarkable rate. He also gets a power boost in this form. His speed, strength, agility, charka, etc are all increase. Narutos' eyes also become red and the pupils become narrower like an animal. In this form Naruto is a full control but he is shown to be a lot more feral and animal like. He once actual went on all fours. It appears that this charka is triggered by rage.<\/p><p>The other version is when Naruto actual goes to the Kyuubi in his body. Naruto demands the kyuubi to give him his charka which he calls \"Rent\" for the kyuubi staying in his body. The kyuubi gives Naruto his charka out of respect for his courage to talk to him like that. Naruto body doesn't change at all but a red charka flows around his body like DBZ. He gets a power boost but its hasn't been said which one of these forms are more powerful.<\/p><h3>1 tails Form<\/h3><p>This is the form after 0 tail form. This form is more powerful the previous form. Naruto has a lot of the qualities of the last form but this makes him looks more like the kyuubi then the previous form. His body is engulfed with chakra that takes the form of a fox. The chakra that engulfs him appears to protect him from damage. That may be true but it also puts constant damage to Naruto body. So he fights while being constantly hurt and constantly healing at the same time. He is able to shoot a chakra hand that extends from the chakra that is surrounding naruto. He is also able to perform Rasengan with the help of the chakra. Naruto is still in control in this form.<\/p><h3>2 Tail Form<\/h3><p>In this form Naruto has all the same abilities as the last. But of course he is more powerful. He looks more monstrous then before. His eyes are widened and the outside of eyes become black. His teeth become sharper and longer. His mouth becomes black too. He has two tails in this form. And the Kyuubi is more noticeable in this form. You see more similarities between the two in this form. Naruto still is in control in this form.<\/p><h3>3 Tails Form<\/h3><p>This form is more powerful then the last and Naruto has the hardest time keeping in control. He could lose control at any moment in this form. In this form the chakra bubbles a lot more then the last ones. He is able to counter a lot of his opponent\u2019s attacks by roaring. In this form he has 3 tails.<\/p><h3>4 Tails form<\/h3><p>This is the latest form we have seen in the Naruto Universe. It is the most powerful out of all the other versions. In this form Naruto body is completely tare off of his body and the Kyuubi Chakra acts like a skin. In this form it has been stated that he is miniature kyuubi. Naruto has absolute no control in this form. Naruto is able to all the same abilities as the last couple of forms but it appears to be harder for Naruto to move in this form. In this form just a swing of his arm can create destructive effects or a simply roar. He was able to create a ball of chakra and swallow it and fire it with explosive effects. Not only is this form Naruto most powerful it is also his most dangerous to himself form. Apparently this form can shorten Naruto Lifespan. While in this form every one of Naruto cells are being destroyed. But more cells are created at the same time. The human body has a limit to the amount of cells that they can produce in their lifespan. If Naruto continues to go into this form his lifespan will be shorten. According to Jiraiya as he reveals to Yamato, Naruto can still think in the Kyuubi form with 0 to 3 tails. However, if he reaches 4 tails, he is entirely consumed by the Kyuubi and cannot think for himself. He also do not consider anyone as his friend as it was shown hurting Sakura.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><p>The kyubbi without naruto as a host has acess to all of it's powers.Including making fire claws.Having a tale that can flatten mountains and cause tsunamis.In mythology his powers include making illusions that are hard to tell from reality.Also he can shoot fireballs from its fur that can burn down forest.Plus he can create roars of pure chakra to flatten trees.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-523540\/","id":523540,"name":"Summer 1997","issue_number":"199703"},"gender":0,"id":46398,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/4204931-7277065069-c2b19.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/4204931-7277065069-c2b19.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/4204931-7277065069-c2b19.png","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/4204931-7277065069-c2b19.png","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/4204931-7277065069-c2b19.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/4204931-7277065069-c2b19.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/4204931-7277065069-c2b19.png"},"name":"Kurama","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-7\/","id":7,"name":"God\/Eternal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-1867\/","id":1867,"name":"Shueisha"},"real_name":"Kurama","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/kurama\/4005-46398\/"},{"aliases":"Alpha Lantern Chaselon\nGreen Lantern of Sector 1416","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-46423\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":194,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:22","date_last_updated":"2014-12-22 10:32:47","deck":"The Green Lantern of Space Sector 1416; one of the first Alpha Lanterns.

The Green Lantern Ring allows Chaselon to manipulate its energies through the use of willpower.<\/b><\/p><p><b>The Green Lantern Ring gives Chaselon the following abilities:<\/b><\/p><ul><li><b>Animating:<\/b> A Green Lantern can will things to move how he wants.<\/li><li><b>Artificial Intelligence:<\/b> Every ring has a connection to the Main Battery on Oa, which taps into an artificial intelligence. It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a Lantern's success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer (though they have difficulty translating profanity), which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Green Lantern ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector. The AI can be used to play a holographic playback sequence complete with colors across the spectrum based on information in memory banks. The ring can dictate when to pause or stop the playback should an interruption arise where the Lanterns undivided attention is needed. The AI can also alert the wielder of incoming threats or of attempts to manipulate the wielders construct by an outside party.<\/li><li><b>Burglar Alarm:<\/b> A Green Lantern can coat anything with the ring's beam and thus, if anyone other than himself touches it, his ring will glow, alerting him to the possible theft.<\/li><li><b>Communicator:<\/b> The ring can act as a personal communicator between Green Lanterns. They have also been seen connected to telephones.<\/li><li><b>Costumes:<\/b> The wearer of the ring may create any costume they choose, based on their personal preferences, whenever they choose. The ring projects the costume over any clothes already worn at the time.<\/li><li><b>Energy Projection:<\/b> The rings can also project beams, form protective bubbles and force fields, and fire destructive blasts. Sometimes, depending on the wearer, the beams and blasts make sounds. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\" href=\"\/kilowog\/4005-6952\/\">Kilowog<\/a>'s ring is one such example of blasts making sounds.<\/li><li><b>Energy Constructs:<\/b> The rings can construct anything the wearer can imagine from hard-light energy, as long as they are willing to make it. The more determined the wearer is, the more complex and intricate these things can be. The constructs can even be so complex as to form working machines, computers, and even people.<\/li><li><b>Flight:<\/b> The ring allows the wearer to fly in atmosphere or in space, and can achieve incredible speeds, moving from planet to planet in a matter of hours.<\/li><li><b>Invisibility:<\/b> The ring can make the wearer or anything else invisible.<\/li><li><b>Matter Manipulation:<\/b> A Green Lantern can use their ring to manipulate nearby matter, such as water, for various purposes such as a construct that acts like an energy construct but can block something yellow and may serve a purpose that an energy construct couldn't perform.<\/li><li><b>Mind Control:<\/b> The wearer of the Ring can use it to plant post hypnotic commands or control a person.<\/li><li><b>Mirages:<\/b> The Ring can create mirages\/illusions.<\/li><li><b>Phasing:<\/b> The ring allows the user to go through walls.<\/li><li><b>Power Absorbing:<\/b> In the JLA's first fight with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\" href=\"\/amazo\/4005-3737\/\">Amazo<\/a>, it was GL who defeated him by drawing out all of Amazo's powers. In Green Lantern\/ <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\" href=\"\/silver-surfer\/4005-2502\/\">Silver Surfer<\/a>: Unholy Alliances, Kyle defeated Parallax with SS' power and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\" href=\"\/thanos\/4005-7607\/\">Thanos<\/a> with Oa's energy by drawing out all that extra energy from them which made them unconscious. However he couldn't hold all that power nor could his Ring like Hal did with Amazo's powers, so that move isn't often used with so much power.<\/li><li><b>Probing:<\/b> The ring can probe the Lantern's or another person's mind, allowing him to uncover memories or the person's thoughts.<\/li><li><b>Radiation:<\/b> Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\" href=\"\/kryptonite\/4055-32213\/\">Kryptonite<\/a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\">Superman<\/a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned.<\/li><li><b>Recharging:<\/b> The rings need to be recharged by means of a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42357\" href=\"\/power-battery\/4015-42357\/\">Power Battery<\/a>. Other large sources of power may be used to recharge a power ring, however effectiveness may vary. The internal power source of a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11316\" href=\"\/manhunter-android\/4005-11316\/\">Manhunter Android<\/a> is, in effect, the same as a power battery, and can be used to recharge a power ring. During the <a data-ref-id=\"4050-10941\" href=\"\/jla-avengers\/4050-10941\/\">JLA \/ Avengers<\/a> crossover, a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\" href=\"\/cosmic-cube\/4055-40949\/\">Cosmic Cube<\/a>was used to recharge a depleted ring, although this is not an ideal solution and is available if there are no other options.<\/li><li><b>Ring Duplication:<\/b> Each ring can duplicate itself, creating a second ring which may be given to another as a backup, for protection, or to help the lantern in times of great need. This duplicate ring is exactly like a normal ring.<\/li><li><b>Temperature Control:<\/b> The Ring can increase or decrease the temperature of anything, even something as large as stars, or even create bubbles of intense heat or cold, even down to Absolute Zero.<\/li><li><b>Transforming:<\/b> The ring can transform anyone or anything, be it into an animal, altering their state of appearance, or their size. Once Hal and Alan turned the two Flashes ( <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\" href=\"\/barry-allen\/4005-22804\/\">Barry<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2395\" href=\"\/jay-garrick\/4005-2395\/\">Jay<\/a>) to light protons in order to free them from prisons.<\/li><li><b>Electro-magnetic scanning:<\/b> The ring can allow(through the use of x rays) the user to see through walls, without the people on the other side knowing. it can also scan along the Electromagnetic spectrum.<\/li><li><b>Wormhole\/Warps:<\/b> The ring can open wormholes to cut down on distance.<\/li><li><b>Time travel:<\/b> The ring allows the wielder the ability to travel through time, though the process requires great willpower.<\/li><li><b>Healing:<\/b> A wielder can command a ring to heal him\/her\/itself of any injures incurred. It can also heal others.<\/li><li><b>Energy twin:<\/b> The ring can create an energy copy of the wielder which is connected to the ring wielder, any information the twin gathers is transferred to the wielder upon touch while others cannot see this twin apart from fellow Green Lanterns.<\/li><li><b>Pocket dimension<\/b>: Within the ring is a pocket dimension which can altered to the wielders specification. It can be used to contain opponents.<\/li><li><b>Sub-routines:<\/b> The power rings have inner programmings or mechanisms which can executed without the users permission. One such sub-routine is the autoshield. This shield automatically protects a wielder from external harm and has been proven to be capable of protecting the wielder from planetary level attacks.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Other Media<\/h2><p>Chaselon had a cameo in Justice League unlimited, with his fellow Green Lantern cohorts, attempting to stop the super cyborg Amazo.

Stel was among the jury who found Jordan innocent of the charges, with the Corp later discovering that Sinestro was responsible for Jordan's odd behavior.<\/p><p>Months later, Stel was among the Corpsmen sent to apprehend a number of prisoners who had escaped from the Guardians prison planet intent on revenge against the Corps. Before Stel and his allies could bring these criminals to justice, they had succeeded in killing thirteen Lanterns in the process, including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50966\" href=\"\/davo-yull\/4005-50966\/\">Davo Yull<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-64338\" href=\"\/chogar\/4005-64338\/\">Chogar<\/a> of Tyrea.<\/p><p>Stel fought with distinction in many notable campaigns including the Corps mission to recover the Central Power Battery from the omnipotent being <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55832\" href=\"\/agamemno\/4005-55832\/\">Agamemno<\/a> and the defense of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\" href=\"\/oa\/4020-41360\/\">Oa<\/a> against the invading forces of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57743\" href=\"\/weaponers-of-qward\/4060-57743\/\">Weaponers of Qward<\/a>. Although Stel was often a part of these larger coalitions, his protection of Sector 3009 never faltered. It has been reported that, during his service, Stel vigilantly preserved the peace within his Sector, most notably in protecting his homeworld Grenda from destruction at the hands of the fanatical Krydos.<\/p><h3>Krona<\/h3><p>When the Guardians banished the renegade Maltusian scientist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-27246\" href=\"\/krona\/4005-27246\/\">Krona<\/a> from the universe he pierced the veil between the world of the living and the dead and caused a tear in the fabric of reality. The resulting rift allowed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45745\" href=\"\/nekron\/4005-45745\/\">Nekron<\/a>, the lord of the unliving, to witness the living universe for the first time. Nekron became enthralled with the idea of bringing death to so many lives, but the rift between universes was too small to allow Nekron entry. He therefore imbued Krona with nearly limitless power, gave him an army of undead to command, and sent Krona to kill the Guardians of the Universe. Nekron knew that, as each Guardian died, their dying energies would widen the rift until it was large enough for Nekron to pass through.<\/p><p>The entire Green Lantern Corps was assembled on Oa to deal with this threat. Stel greeted his friend Hal Jordan, who was pleased to hear that Stel had developed a friendship with fellow earth Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50919\" href=\"\/charlie-vicker\/4005-50919\/\">Charlie Vicker<\/a>. Shortly after the Guardians arrived to inform the Corps of the universal threat, Krona struck the first blow by sabotaging the Central Power Battery. The Battery exploded, killing many Lanterns, and preventing the surviving Corps from recharging their rings. Now faced with only 24 hours of power, the corps split up into two teams.<\/p><p>Stel raced ahead of his fellow Lanterns and was the first to encounter Krona. The immensely powerful villain was unfazed by Stel\u2019s attack. Krona set upon Stel with blinding speed, and brutally torn the robotic lantern to pieces. Stel\u2019s companions arrived too late to aid their fallen friend. Stel slowly deactivated in the arms of fellow Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49734\" href=\"\/mdahna\/4005-49734\/\">M\u2019Dahna<\/a>. With his last words Stel alerted the Corps to the fact that Krona was causing the universe to collapse into itself. His intelligence proved vital in the Corps ultimate defeat of Krona and his undead master.<\/p><h3>Rebirth<\/h3><p>With Stel gone, his ring passed to a being from a different world with Sector 3009. Back on Grenda, the automatons gathered before a memorial to Stel to mourn their fallen champion. The occasion was marred by the obnoxious boasting of one being. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50783\" href=\"\/yron\/4005-50783\/\">Yron<\/a> of Grenda viewed Stel as a weakling and coward. He arrogantly insisted that, were he chosen to serve the Corps, he would have been a far better Lantern then Stel ever was.<\/p><p>Before he could be shouted down by the crowd, Yron was interrupted by an attack by the Krydos. The Krydos had long viewed the robotic life on Grenda as an abomination, and with Stel gone, they saw an opportunity to exterminate the Grendians once and for all.<\/p><p>The Krydos advanced weaponry killed many Grendians, but their attack was soon halted by the arrival of Sector 3009\u2019s newest Lantern. The Lantern quickly cut through the Krydos, turning back their attack. However, one Grendian was not pleased to see the Green Lantern. Yron was outraged that the Guardians would chose an \u201calien\u201d over him to act as Stel\u2019s replacement.<\/p><p>Yron leaped into the air and onto the Green Lantern\u2019s back and wrapped his arms around the Lanterns throat. Yron insisted on being taken to Oa so that he could confront the Guardians in person about their lack of judgment. Although he could have easily overpowered Yron, the Lantern complied, reasoning that the Guardian would soon teach this upstart a lesson about the Corp.<\/p><p>On Oa, Yron chastised the Guardians for failing to recognize his greatness and insisted that they make him a Lantern. Surprisingly, the Guardians complied. They outfitted Yron, and sent him back to Grenda moments before the Krydos renewed their attack. Yron proved to be a disastrous Lantern. His arrogance and grandstanding made him sloppy, and many Grendians died due to his careless use of power.<\/p><p>Yron was horrified by the carnage his failure had caused. He dropped his guard long enough for the Krydos to blast him with a killing blow. Humbled and near death, Yron stumbled to the memorial to Stel. There he sacrificed his remaining life-force to resurrect Grenda\u2019s true Green Lantern. Stel was reborn.<\/p><p>With a veterans skill, Stel dispatched the Krydos and restored peace to Grenda. He then silenced Yron\u2019s critics amongst the surviving Grendians and altered his former memorial to serve as a monument to the sacrifice Yron made for his people.<\/p><h3>Fall of the Corps \/ Fatality<\/h3><p>Stel resumed service in the Corps, and was among the Lanterns present when the Guardians left the universe with the Zamarons. Some months later, Stel was amongst the Lanterns assembled during the trial an execution of Sinestro. Like all of the Lanterns assembled, Stel lost his power when the Central Power Battery melted down.<\/p><p>After the fall of the Corps, little else was known about Stel\u2019s whereabouts. He was not among the few veterans assembled by Hal Jordan during the Corps brief rebirth. Months after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\" href=\"\/parallax\/4005-41293\/\">Parallax<\/a> destroyed the Corps for a second time, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\" href=\"\/john-stewart\/4005-10451\/\">John Stewart<\/a> discovered Stel\u2019s severed head aboard Fatality\u2019s starship. The deadly warrior claimed Stel as one of the many former Green Lanterns she hunted and killed, but it was never established with certainty that this head actually belonged to Stel, or that the loss of his head would have meant the total deactivation of the robotic Lantern.<\/p><h3>Rebirth of the Corps<\/h3><p><b>For further details: <a data-ref-id=\"4045-54588\" href=\"\/green-lantern-rebirth\/4045-54588\/\">Green Lantern: Rebirth<\/a><\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7658\/408700-156395-stel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-408700\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"1.1625\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7658\/408700-156395-stel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-408700\"><img alt=\"Stel rejoins the Corps\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7658\/408700-156395-stel.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7658\/408700-156395-stel.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/a><figcaption>Stel rejoins the Corps<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Despite Stewart\u2019s discovery, Stel was among the many veterans who returned to the newly reformed Corps following the restoration of Oa and the rebirth of the Guardians. Stel developed a friendship with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47281\" href=\"\/green-man\/4005-47281\/\">Green Man of Uxor<\/a> and became a trusted senior Lantern among peers like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\" href=\"\/guy-gardner\/4005-1791\/\">Guy Gardner<\/a>, Kilowog, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\" href=\"\/kyle-rayner\/4005-40431\/\">Kyle Rayner<\/a>.<\/p><p>During the Spider Guild\u2019s invasion, Stel and Green Man refused to join the earth Lanterns in breaking the Guardian\u2019s orders against entering the Vega System. Stel and Green Man did remain on the boarder of the forbidden system, and were on hand to stop the bounty hunters who chased the earthmen as the fled Vega with news of the Spider guild\u2019s attack on Oa. When the Guild did attack, Stel was among the Lanterns who fought and repelled the invading hordes from the Lanterns headquarters.<\/p><h3>Sinestro Corps War<\/h3><p><b>For further details: <a data-ref-id=\"4045-50650\" href=\"\/sinestro-corps-war\/4045-50650\/\">Sinestro Corps War<\/a><\/b><\/p><p>The renegade Sinestro had been quietly assembling an army of yellow ring bearers to spread his message of fear across the universe. as a prelude to his main attack, Sinetro sent the sentient virus <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45573\" href=\"\/despotellis\/4005-45573\/\">Despotellis<\/a> to poison the planetary lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41919\" href=\"\/mogo\/4005-41919\/\">Mogo<\/a> with its mind controlling spoors.<\/p><p>Green Man was on Mogo when Despotellis attacked, and was infected by the evil virus. When Green Man and Stel attempted to prevent a starship from meltdown, the possessed Green Man caused the reactor to blow by mixing matter with anti-matter. Stel was seemingly destroyed by the resulting blast.<\/p><p>Green Man was cleansed of the virus after Despotellis attack was uncovered by Guy Gardner. Distraught over the death of his friend, Green man refused to believe that Stel was dead. Green Man was moved to tears as he scoured the space near Mogo for any signs of his friend. His faith was rewarded when he discovered a badly damaged but active Stel, floating aimlessly.<\/p><p>Much to Green Man\u2019s joy, Stel managed to reverse the polarity of his atoms seconds before the explosions, preserving parts of his head arm and body. Their reunion was soon interrupted by an army of Sinestro Corps soldiers intent on attacking and destroying Mogo. Stel used his power ring to construct the rest of his body and the two Lanterns prepared to defend Mogo alone against the invading force. Stel calculated the impossible odds of their survival, amending them slightly upon the arrival of Mogo\u2019s partner the fly-like Lantern, Bzzd. The battle for Mogo raged on with a contingent of Corpsmen, led by Kilowog, arriving in time to save Mogo from destruction. Stel fought with distinction in the Sinestro Corps War, standing among those Lanterns who invaded and destroyed Ranx the Sentient City. When the Sinestro Corps attacked Earth, Stel and Green man defended Las Vegas from Sinners intent on taking the city. Green Man noted with some humor that Stel was fascinated by Vegas\u2019 games of chance, and suggested returning to the City of Sin when the war ended.<\/p><h3>Prelude to Blackest Night<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/778285-stel.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-778285\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 300px\" data-ratio=\"1.5666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/778285-stel.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-778285\"><img alt=\"Updated Stel\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 0px) 100vw, 0px\" data-width=\"0\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/778285-stel.png\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/778285-stel.png 0w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Updated Stel\" src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/778285-stel.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/778285-stel.png 0w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 0px) 100vw, 0px\" data-width=\"0\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Updated Stel<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Following the wars end, Stel attempted to repair his body by magnetically drawing in tons of space debris from around the galaxy.

Mongul had obtained a Sinestro Corps ring and used it to reverse engineer the empathy inducing spoors of the Black Mercy plant into a bioweapon he spread throughout the universe. Stel and his companions battled Mongul, resulting in the seeming death of the villain and the tragic loss of Bzzd.<\/p><p>Following the ring quest, Stel was pursuing and attempting to apprehend a Sinestro Corps soldier. When the pursuit took Stel into the Vega Sector he was attacked by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58504\" href=\"\/larfleeze\/4005-58504\/\">Larfleeze<\/a> and branded with the symbol of the Orange Lantern Corp. Larfleeze had recently been attacked by the Controllers, an attack which the Orange Lantern attributed to the Guardians.<\/p><p>The badly damaged Stel was taken to Oa, where a construct of Larfleeze emerged from the brand on Stel\u2019s chest and threatened to destroy the Guardians for breaking their truce. After this attack Stel rebuilt himself once again, adopting a much more powerful and imposing body. Stel then joined the Guardians in invading Vega and confronting Larfleeze.<\/p><p>Stel later served in the defense of Oa during the Blackest Night. When Kilowog decided that he needed a break from the position of Corp Drill Instructor, he selected Stel as his replacement, a selection that was approved by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11304\" href=\"\/salaak\/4005-11304\/\">Salaak<\/a>. Stel accepted this duty, but made it clear that he was only holding the position until Kilowog was ready to return to duty.<\/p><p><b>War of The Green Lanterns<\/b><\/p><p>Recently, In War of the Green Lanterns the guardians have dispatched a team of Green Lanterns lead by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11304\" href=\"\/salaak\/4005-11304\/\">Salaak<\/a> to recover Hal Jordan for treason against the universe and to the Green Lantern Corps.

The Green Lantern Ring allows Stel to manipulate its energies through the use of willpower.<\/b><\/p><p><b>The Green Lantern Ring gives Stel the following abilities:<\/b><\/p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Animating:<\/b> A Green Lantern can will things to move how he wants.<\/li><li><b>Artificial Intelligence:<\/b> Every ring has a connection to the Main Battery on Oa, which taps into an artificial intelligence. It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a Lantern's success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer (though they have difficulty translating profanity), which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Green Lantern ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector. The AI can be used to play a holographic playback sequence complete with colors across the spectrum based on information in memory banks. The ring can dictate when to pause or stop the playback should an interruption arise where the Lanterns undivided attention is needed. The AI can also alert the wielder of incoming threats or of attempts to manipulate the wielders construct by an outside party.<\/li><li><b>Burglar Alarm:<\/b> A Green Lantern can coat anything with the ring's beam and thus, if anyone other than himself touches it, his ring will glow, alerting him to the possible theft.<\/li><li><b>Communicator:<\/b> The ring can act as a personal communicator between Green Lanterns. They have also been seen connected to telephones.<\/li><li><b>Costumes:<\/b> The wearer of the ring may create any costume they choose, based on their personal preferences, whenever they choose. The ring projects the costume over any clothes already worn at the time.<\/li><li><b>Energy Projection:<\/b> The rings can also project beams, form protective bubbles and force fields, and fire destructive blasts. Sometimes, depending on the wearer, the beams and blasts make sounds. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\" href=\"\/kilowog\/4005-6952\/\">Kilowog<\/a>'s ring is one such example of blasts making sounds.<\/li><li><b>Energy Constructs:<\/b> The rings can construct anything the wearer can imagine from hard-light energy, as long as they are willing to make it. The more determined the wearer is, the more complex and intricate these things can be. The constructs can even be so complex as to form working machines, computers, and even people.<\/li><li><b>Flight:<\/b> The ring allows the wearer to fly in atmosphere or in space, and can achieve incredible speeds, moving from planet to planet in a matter of hours.<\/li><li><b>Invisibility:<\/b> The ring can make the wearer or anything else invisible.<\/li><li><b>Matter Manipulation:<\/b> A Green Lantern can use their ring to manipulate nearby matter, such as water, for various purposes such as a construct that acts like an energy construct but can block something yellow and may serve a purpose that an energy construct couldn't perform.<\/li><li><b>Mind Control:<\/b> The wearer of the Ring can use it to plant post hypnotic commands or control a person.<\/li><li><b>Mirages:<\/b> The Ring can create mirages\/illusions.<\/li><li><b>Phasing:<\/b> The ring allows the user to go through walls.<\/li><li><b>Power Absorbing:<\/b> In the JLA's first fight with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\" href=\"\/amazo\/4005-3737\/\">Amazo<\/a>, it was GL who defeated him by drawing out all of Amazo's powers.

However he couldn't hold all that power nor could his Ring like Hal did with Amazo's powers, so that move isn't often used with so much power.<\/li><li><b>Probing:<\/b> The ring can probe the Lantern's or another person's mind, allowing him to uncover memories or the person's thoughts.<\/li><li><b>Radiation:<\/b> Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\" href=\"\/kryptonite\/4055-32213\/\">Kryptonite<\/a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\">Superman<\/a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned.<\/li><li><b>Recharging:<\/b> The rings need to be recharged by means of a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-42357\" href=\"\/power-battery\/4015-42357\/\">Power Battery<\/a>.

This duplicate ring is exactly like a normal ring.<\/li><li><b>Temperature Control:<\/b> The Ring can increase or decrease the temperature of anything, even something as large as stars, or even create bubbles of intense heat or cold, even down to Absolute Zero.<\/li><li><b>Transforming:<\/b> The ring can transform anyone or anything, be it into an animal, altering their state of appearance, or their size.

It can also heal others.<\/li><li><b>Energy twin:<\/b> The ring can create an energy copy of the wielder which is connected to the ring wielder, any information the twin gathers is transferred to the wielder upon touch while others cannot see this twin apart from fellow Green Lanterns.<\/li><li><b>Pocket dimension<\/b>: Within the ring is a pocket dimension which can altered to the wielders specification. It can be used to contain opponents.<\/li><li><b>Sub-routines:<\/b> The power rings have inner programmings or mechanisms which can executed without the users permission. One such sub-routine is the autoshield. This shield automatically protects a wielder from external harm and has been proven to be capable of protecting the wielder from planetary level attacks.<\/li><li><b><\/b><h2><b>Retconned<\/b><\/h2><b><\/b><p><b>Radiation:<\/b> Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\" href=\"\/kryptonite\/4055-32213\/\">Kryptonite<\/a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\">Superman<\/a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned.<\/p><p><b>Time travel:<\/b> The ring allows the wielder the ability to travel through time, though the process requires great willpower.<\/p><h2>Weaknesses<\/h2><b>Mental Incapacitation<\/b>: The ring cannot be wielded correctly if the wearer is under the influence of drugs or if there is an involvement of neural interference.<br \/><br \/><b>Yellow Impurity:<\/b> In the beginning the Green Ring was vulnerable to the color yellow. It was unable to defend against attacks from wielders of the Sinestro Corps as well. This weakness however has now be changed and can be overcome by veterans who have the ability to overcome great fear. Hal Jordan was of the first of the Green Lanterns to show that this weakness could be overcome.<br \/><br \/><b>Recharge<\/b>: Previously had to be recharged every 24 hours or when it has been depleted of energy. This can be accomplished if the bearer of the ring recites an oath into his power lantern while holding the ring to it. However now, the power ring only needs to be recharged when it runs out of energy.

His race evolved on their water soaked world from amphibious ancestors, and they still possess small gills beneath the lower jaw that allow for breathing underwater.<\/p><p>The Green Man's race has developed a communal society where group goals are stressed and individuality is scorned. The Uxorans take no personal possessions, not even a name. They are called by the life-task to which they are assigned, and identify each other by their distinctive skin patterns. The Green Man was a misfit who longed for personal identity, and when he was approached by the <a href=\"\/guardians-of-the-universe\/4060-9057\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians of the Universe<\/a> he took the name of <a href=\"\/green-lantern\/4015-41148\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\">Green Lantern<\/a> with pride.<\/p><p>The Green Lantern successfully patrolled his space sector for a number of years, learning much from his encounters with evil. At length, his space sector was infiltrated by the notorious <a href=\"\/spider-guild\/4060-55986\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55986\">Spider Guild<\/a>, and though he defeated individual attacks by them several times, they gained a foothold even with the help of the other <a href=\"\/green-lantern-corps\/4060-6992\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps<\/a> members could not dislodge. Seeing that the Spider Guild was continuing its incursions into the Vega system, the Green Man secretly traveled there to find allies, disobeying a non-interference pact between the Guardians of the Universe and the <a href=\"\/psions\/4060-56376\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56376\">Psions<\/a> of that region.<\/p><p>Meeting <a href=\"\/kalista\/4005-54024\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54024\">Kalista<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/omega-men\/4060-14632\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14632\">Omega Men<\/a> on the planet Rashashoon, the Green Man convinced them to return with him. Together, they destroyed the Spider Guild nest that seemed to be directing the Vegan attack.<\/p><p>When the Guardians noted what he had done, they reprimanded the Green Man, ordering him not to reenter Vegan space. When the time came to part from his allies, they were in such peril that he could not in good conscience leave them. He decided to stay with the Omega Men and offered any help he could without using his power ring. Soon after, the group was captured by the Psions, and the Uxoran's ring and power battery were confiscated. These actions caused this Green Lantern to give up the name and he asked his friends to call him Green Man instead. This Green Man would die during Invasion. A new Green Man has joined the ranks of The Green Lantern Corps.<\/p><p>The second Uxorian known as Green Man was the sector partner of the robotic <a href=\"\/stel\/4005-47279\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47279\">Stel<\/a>.

He became a major of god of ancient Egyptian religion in the years 2495 - 2345, and is usually portrayed by the mid-day sun. Though the meaning of the word Ra is unclear, it either means the sun, or a word or a phrase that means creative power or creator. Ra was centerly worshiped in the ancient Egyptian city of Heliopolis.<\/p><p>All forms of life were believed to have been created by Ra, who called each of them into existence by speaking their secret names. Alternatively humans were created from Ra's tears and sweat, hence the Egyptians call themselves the \"Cattle of Ra.\" In the myth of the Celestial Cow it is recounted how mankind plotted against Ra and how he sent his eye as the goddess Sekhmet to punish them. When she became bloodthirsty she was pacified by mixing beer with red dye.<\/p><p>o the Egyptians, the sun represented light, warmth, and growth. This made the sun deity very important, as the sun was seen as the ruler of all that he created. The sun disk was either seen as the body or the eye or Ra. Ra was the father of Shu and Tefnut, whom he created. Shu was the god of the wind, and Tefnut was the goddess of the rain. Sekhmet was the Eye of Ra and was created by the fire in Ra's eye. She was a violent lioness.<\/p><h3>Gods merged with Ra<\/h3><p>As with most of the most widely worshipped gods of Anceint Egypt, Ra was often merged with that of the local gods. <\/p><p><strong>Amun and Amun-Ra<\/strong><\/p><p>Amun was a member of the Ogdoad. He was the god of creation in Thebes with his wife Amaunet. He created life through breathing, and was considered a god of the winds. Its unclear how and when the two gods were fused to be called Amun-Ra, but the diety became very popular in the upper and Lower Egypt during that time. References to Amun-Ra appear in pyramid texts dating back to the fifth dynesty. Most likely, the Theban rulers adopted Amun-Ra as the state deity to unite the Ra cult and the Amun worshippers in the New Kingdom around the 18th century. Worshippers named Amun-Ra, the king of gods. This title became official. <\/p><p><strong>Atum and Atum-Ra<\/strong><\/p><p>Atum-Ra (or Ra-Atum) was another composite deity formed from two completely separate deities, however Ra shared more similarities with Atum than with Amun. Atum was more closely linked with the sun, and was also a creator god of the Ennead. Both Ra and Atum were regarded as the father of the deities and pharaohs, and were widely worshiped. In older myths, Atum was the creator of Tefnut and Shu, and he was born from Nun.<\/p><p><strong>Ra-Horakhty<\/strong><\/p><p>In later Egyptian mythology, Ra-Horakhty was more of a title or manifestation than a composite deity. It translates as \"Ra (who is) Horus of the Horizons\". It was intended to link Horakhty (as a sunrise-oriented aspect of Horus) to Ra. It has been suggested that Ra-Horakhty simply refers to the sun's journey from horizon to horizon as Ra, or that it means to show Ra as a symbolic deity of hope and rebirth.<\/p><p><strong>Khepri and Khnum<\/strong><\/p><p>Khepri was a scarab beetle who rolled up the sun in the mornings, and was sometimes seen as the morning manifestation of Ra. Similarly, the ram-headed god Khnum was also seen as the evening manifestation of Ra. The idea of different deities (or different aspects of Ra) ruling over different times of the day was fairly common, but variable. With Khepri and Khnum taking precedence over sunrise and sunset, Ra often was the representation of midday when the sun reached its peak at noon. Sometimes different aspects of Horus were used instead of Ra's aspects.<\/p><p><strong>Raet-Tawy<\/strong><\/p><p>Raet or Raet-Tawy was a female aspect of Ra; she did not have much of importance independently of him. In some myths she was considered to be either Ra's wife or his daughter.<\/p><h3>Gods created by Ra<\/h3><p>Being a major god of Egypt, Ra was involved with the creation of other gods.<\/p><p><strong>Bastet<\/strong><\/p><p>Sometimes known as the cat of Ra, she is the daughter of Ra and his instrument of vengeance, an \"eye of the Sun God\". She most known for decapitating the serphent and rival god of Ra, Apophis (the God of Chaos) in order to protect Ra. In one myth, Ra sends Bastet to Nubia in the form of a lioness.<\/p><p><strong>Sekhmet<\/strong><\/p><p>Sekhmet is another daughter of Ra. Sekhemet was depicted as a lioness or large cat, and was an \"eye of Ra\", or an instrument of the sun god's vengeance. In one myth, Sekhmet was so filled with rage that Ra was forced to turn her into a cow so that she would not cause unnecessary harm. In another myth, Ra fears that mankind is plotting against him and sends Hathor (another daughter of Ra) to exterminate the human race. In the morning Sekhmet goes to finish the job and drinks what appears to be blood. It turns out to be red beer, and she is too intoxicated to finish the slaughter.<sup><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ra#cite_note-Hart_Sekhmet-13\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br \/><\/a><\/sup><\/p><p><strong>Hathor<\/strong><\/p><p>Hathor is another daughter of Ra. When Ra feared that mankind was plotting against him, he sent Hathor as an \"eye of Ra\" to exterminate the human race, later sending Sekhmet to finish the job. In one myth, Hathor danced naked in front of Ra until he laughed to cure him of a fit of sulking. When Ra was without Hathor, he fell into a state of deep depression.<sup><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ra#cite_note-15\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br \/><\/a><\/sup><\/p><p><strong>Rival Gods<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Ptah<\/strong><\/p><p>Ptah is rarely mentioned in the literature of Old Kingdom pyramids. This is believed by some to be a result of the Ra-worshipping people of Heliopolis being the main writers of these inscriptions. Followers of Ra were known to be jealous of Ptah. While some believed that Ra created himself, others believed that Ptah created him.<sup><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ra#cite_note-16\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br \/><\/a><\/sup><\/p><p><strong>Isis<\/strong><\/p><p>Isis frequently schemed against Ra, as she wanted her son Horus to have the power. In one myth, Isis created a serpent to poison Ra and only gave him the antidote when he revealed his true name to her. Ra now feared Isis, as with his secret name revealed she could use all her power against him and have Horus take over the throne.<sup><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ra#cite_note-Harris_secret_name-17\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br \/><\/a><\/sup><\/p><p><strong>Apep<\/strong><\/p><p>Apep also called Apophis, was the god of chaos and Ra's greatest enemy. He was said to lie just below the horizon line, trying to devour Ra as Ra descended into the underworld. As he swallowed Ra, this led to the setting of the sun and when he had completely swallowed Ra this lead to nighttime. He never succeeded in completely swallowing Ra however as he eventually spit Ra back out, causing the sun to rise.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-15823\/","id":15823,"name":"The Immortal Destiny","issue_number":"9"},"gender":0,"id":47899,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/374376-182903-ra.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/374376-182903-ra.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/374376-182903-ra.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/374376-182903-ra.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/374376-182903-ra.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/374376-182903-ra.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/374376-182903-ra.jpg"},"name":"Ra","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-7\/","id":7,"name":"God\/Eternal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-2526\/","id":2526,"name":"In the Public Domain"},"real_name":"Ra","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/ra\/4005-47899\/"},{"aliases":"Phlutdroid\r\nIG-88A\r\nIG-88B\r\nIG-88C\r\nIG-88D\r\nIG-88","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-47938\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":62,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:26:49","date_last_updated":"2016-09-18 06:07:03","deck":"An assassin droid who operated out of a droid factory on Mechis III, IG-88 took the facade a bounty hunter, but wished to usher in the era of droid domination and to exterminate all biological life.","description":"<h2>History<\/h2><blockquote><p><em>\"I think, therefore I am.

They contained his powerful laser cannon in an energy bubble until the weapon overloaded and exploded. <\/p> <p>Although Sinestro appeared to have been destroyed, the insane Sector 3600 lashed out over the loss of its ally and responded by ripping open a black hole that transported the Lanterns across the universe to space sector 872.<\/p> <p>The Lanterns had little time to catch their breaths as they were soon attacked by the only five remaining life forms in the barren sector. These aliens had extinguished all life within sector 872, including the two Green Lanterns of that region of space. After a vicious battle, the Lanterns overcame the hostile aliens and took possession of their world. <\/p> <p>Following the battle, the Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\" href=\"\/kilowog\/4005-6952\/\">Kilowog<\/a> revealed that prior to the destruction of his home world Bolovax Vik; he had transferred the life force of the entire population into his ring. <\/p> <p>Kilowog believed that this desolate planet could finally be the new home he had been searching for.

Kilowog was driven temporarily insane with grief, while the remaining Lanterns desperately battled Sinestro and the living galaxy. <\/p> <p>Their defeat seemed inevitable, until the Corp conceived a plan wherein Flodo Span would enlarge his ring generated body to an infinite size, capable of containing the mad sector 3600. The strain of expanding his existence caused Flodo Span to lose his sanity and grip on reality. He was saved by the dead and zombie-like Driq, whose destroyed body would constantly be reassembled by his power ring.<\/p> <p>Although Driq was blown up by Sinestro, his ring soon pulled together both its disembodied owner and the expanding Flodo Span. This compressed the mad sector within the now sane Flodo Span, neutralizing the threat. Without his ally, Sinestro was easily defeated by an enraged and vengeful <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10445\" href=\"\/katma-tui\/4005-10445\/\">Katma Tui<\/a>. The Earth Corps then parted ways with Flodo Span and the Klyminade Corps. <\/p> <p>Sinestro was taken prisoner by the Earth Lanterns, and was put on trial before the entire reassembled Green Lanterns Corps. Flodo Span and the Klyminade Lanterns Olapet and Driq also traveled to Oa to witness the Lanterns greatest villain tried for his crimes. <\/p> <p>Sinestro was found guilty and sentenced to death; unfortunately, the assembled Lanterns never knew that the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\" href=\"\/central-power-battery\/4055-55704\/\">Central Power Battery<\/a> contained a failsafe that would result in the end of the Lantern Corps.

The two Lanterns soon discovered how deadly the inside of the battery would be to a being composed almost entirely out of Oan energy. Flodo Span\u2019s power ring was soon absorbed by the battery itself. <\/p> <p>Without the power to generate form, Flodo Span was dissipated into the void of the central power battery and presumed dead.

He was in their service. One day the jedi masters sent their padawans on a training mission to an asteroid in space, constantly bombarded by comets. Elbee assisted them in the construction of a large shield dome which would protect the jedi while they meditated. As they meditated on this asteroid, the jedi saw a dark vision of a padawan who would kill the jedi and start the sith once again. Fearing that the padawan in the vision was one of the padawan down on the asteroid, the jedi planned to kill all of their padawan. But they forgot that Elbee was listening and <b>Lucien<\/b> Draay, one of the jedi masters, pushed Elbee off of a large cliff, thus \"killing\" him (though a droid can't actually be \"killed\")<br \/><br \/><b>Revival<br \/><br \/><\/b>Later, Zayne Carrick accompanied by Jarel, discovered Elbee on the comet and decided to repair him, anticipating that he would have knowlege about his masters. They find the droid but Lucien and the members of the jedi covenant find Zayne and attack him. Zayne and his crew take Elbee aboard their ship and get away just in time. While the droid is aboard their ship, Camper discovers a way to reactivate the droid. He manages to successfully reactivate Elbee, who tells Zayne everything about what happened upon the comet. Zayne is horrified but is glad that he knows the information.<br \/><br \/><b>K-OB7<br \/><br \/><\/b>From this point, he is used in various missions. Gryph tends to manipulate Elbee's ignorance and stern distaste for Lucien Draay to accomplish his own ends. Zayne is opposed to manipulating the droid this way, but has trouble convincing Gryph to stop. Elbee saves Zayne and his friends many times during their adventures. Along those adventures, Elbee discoveres another droid named K-OB7, who he befriends. Elbee even goes so far as to attack Zayne and his friends in order to protect K-OB7. Not much is known about K-OB7 other than that he and Elbee were made by the same manufacturers, a fact that enhanced the friendship between them. <\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30867\/881000-486px_elbee_zayne_kotor38.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-881000\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2345679012346\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30867\/881000-486px_elbee_zayne_kotor38.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-881000\"><img alt=\"Elbee attacking Zayne to defend his new friend\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30867\/881000-486px_elbee_zayne_kotor38.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30867\/881000-486px_elbee_zayne_kotor38.jpg 486w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" data-width=\"777\"><\/a><figcaption>Elbee attacking Zayne to defend his new friend<\/figcaption><\/figure>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-120494\/","id":120494,"name":"Commencement, Part 4","issue_number":"4"},"gender":0,"id":50908,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/300789-140384-t1-lb.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/300789-140384-t1-lb.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/300789-140384-t1-lb.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/300789-140384-t1-lb.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/300789-140384-t1-lb.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/300789-140384-t1-lb.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/300789-140384-t1-lb.jpg"},"name":"T1-LB","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-5\/","id":5,"name":"Robot"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-364\/","id":364,"name":"Dark Horse Comics"},"real_name":"T1-LB","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/t1-lb\/4005-50908\/"},{"aliases":"Guardian of Earth","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-51164\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":57,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:25:00","date_last_updated":"2016-11-16 15:22:36","deck":"Dende is was lone survivor of his village on planet Namek.

Several years later the memory resurfaced, and he took direct action to monitor the Justice League and any other metahumans.<\/p><p>Brother MK I was built using money through various Wayne Industries subsidiaries, and programmed by Pseudopersons Inc. scientist <a href=\"\/buddy-blank\/4005-48221\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48221\">Buddy Blank<\/a>. A semi-autonomous artificial surveillance system with an anti-detection stealth system, the satellite was launched into geosynchronous orbit to monitor every metahuman, good or evil, on Earth. Batman's database system was eventually hacked by <a href=\"\/ras-al-ghul\/4005-40816\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\">Ra's al Ghul<\/a>, who exploited the weaknesses of the JLA. Ra's was eventually defeated, but the JLA lost their trust in Batman after learning how the villain gained his knowledge. The standing roster of the JLA at that time were not members of the original Doctor Light conspiracy, and had no prior knowledge of what had taken place. Batman did not openly reveal his knowledge of the conspiracy to his teammates at the that time.<\/p><h3>Post-Flashpoint \/ Earth 0<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/2067094-eye_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2067094\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1093439363817\" data-width=\"503\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 503px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/2067094-eye_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2067094\"><img alt=\"Brother Eye (Earth 0)\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" data-width=\"576\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/2067094-eye_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/2067094-eye_1.jpg 503w, http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/2067094-eye_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Brother Eye (Earth 0)\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/2067094-eye_1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/2067094-eye_1.jpg 503w, http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/2067094-eye_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" data-width=\"576\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Brother Eye (Earth 0)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Brother Eye turns <a href=\"\/kevin-kho\/4005-79803\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79803\">Kevin Kho<\/a> into OMAC.<\/p><p>He recruits Kevin Kho into battling Maxwell Lord and Checkmate.

Ranx was destroyed by Sodam Yat during the battle to save Mogo.","description":"<h2>Profile<\/h2><ul><li>Sinestro Soldier Status: Deceased?<\/li><li>Space Sector: 73<\/li><li>Sector Partner: ?<\/li><li>Homeworld: <b>Unknown<\/b><\/li><li>Predecessor: Inapplicable<\/li><li>Successor: Unknown<\/li><\/ul><h2>Storyline<\/h2><p>One of the more unusual lifeforms in the universe is Ranx the Sentient City. Its origins are unknown. According to folklore, Ranx is as old as the stars. Circuitry running across and through each quadrant of the city enables Ranx to observe and act upon anything in his vicinity. Ranx can control gravitational forces in virtually any area, and control the very ground itself. Data feeds connect to a command center with a central processing unit, perhaps a quasi-organic brain.<\/p><p>In ancient times, Ranx was located at the crossroads of trade routes located in Space Sector 73. A thriving port, Ranx eventually grew greedy and fed upon the lives within it, growing hungry for more inhabitants. Crime and vice took hold among the population until the city itself became a source of evil.<\/p><p>The <a href=\"\/green-lantern-corps\/4060-6992\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps<\/a> had to shut the city down for the good of the sector. When the trade routes diverted, Ranx became no more than a deserted husk. Over the eons, the city drifted into a backwater nebula and was all but forgotten, but Ranx would never forget what the Corps had done. Ranx's only inhabitants became criminals and drifters with nowhere else to go.<\/p><p>In the early 21st century, a member of the religious cult known as the <a href=\"\/children-of-the-white-lobe\/4060-53828\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-53828\">Children of the White Lobe<\/a> abducted the daughter of a politician from one of the worlds in the Mytonian Cleft. Green Lanterns <a href=\"\/chthos-chthas-chthatis\/4005-49782\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49782\">Chthos-Chthas Chthatis<\/a> and <a href=\"\/guy-gardner\/4005-1791\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\">Guy Gardner<\/a> tracked the kidnapper to Ranx. His long hatred of the Green Lantern Corps had not abated, and Ranx brought the very ground to rise against the ring wielders in the form of a giant humanoid. When that attack failed, Ranx tried to block their way with gravitational distortions. Finally, the Green Lanterns threatened to disconnect Ranx from his data feeds. Unable to fend them off, Ranx did not prevent them from locating the lobe-spawn.<\/p><p>Though they thwarted the kidnapping, they were unable to capture the lobe-spawn as she detonated herself in a massive blast described like existence itself blinking. The blast caused Ranx traumatic peristalsis which vomited the intruders out of Ranx. Years ago, the Green Lantern Corps had made Ranx lonely. Now, the Green Lantern Corps had humiliated him. For this, Ranx swore revenge.<\/p><p>The resurfacing of Ranx as well as the rise of the Children of the White Lobe was of particular concern to the <a href=\"\/guardians-of-the-universe\/4060-9057\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians of the Universe<\/a>. Years ago, <a href=\"\/abin-sur\/4005-22634\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22634\">Abin Sur<\/a> of <a href=\"\/ungara\/4020-56221\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56221\">Ungara<\/a>, then-Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814, broke the Guardians' quarantine of <a href=\"\/ysmault\/4020-55871\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55871\">Ysmault <\/a>to rescue the survivors of a crashed Ungaran spaceship. He was offered assistance by the entombed demons known as the <a href=\"\/empire-of-tears\/4060-56436\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56436\">Empire of Tears<\/a>. One of the demons, <a href=\"\/quill\/4005-26057\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26057\">Qull of the Five Inversions<\/a>, promised to give the answers to any three questions. The third question, known as the Prophecy of the Darkest Night concerned the final battle of the Green Lantern Corps.<\/p><p>\"After untold millennia, the enemies of the Green Lantern Corps will rise united against them. The Corps shall be destroyed to the last life form. The planet <a href=\"\/oa\/4020-41360\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41360\">Oa<\/a> shall be as dust. Among the gathered foeman shall be numbered the <a href=\"\/weaponers-of-qward\/4005-11315\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11315\">Weaponers of Qward<\/a>, Ranx the Sentient City, and the unspeakable Children of the White Lobe. The Empire of Tears, finally released from entombment, shall join the assault. <a href=\"\/ion\/4005-46185\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46185\">Sodam Yat<\/a>, a <a href=\"\/daxamites\/4060-42480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42480\">Daxamite<\/a> hailed as the ultimate Green Lantern will perish battling the lobe-spawn. The planet-form Green Lantern <a href=\"\/mogo\/4005-41919\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41919\">Mogo<\/a> will be the last to fall as Ranx explodes a blink-bomb within his core.\"<\/p><p>Ranx was at some point inducted into the <a href=\"\/sinestro-corps\/4060-42352\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42352\">Sinestro Corps<\/a>, though it is not confirmed if he wielded a <a href=\"\/sinestro-corps-ring\/4055-53415\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53415\">yellow power ring<\/a>. His size was increased dramatically, from city to that of a moon. The Sinestro Corps were given room to torture their enemies within Ranx. The Children of the White Lobe united with Ranx and the Sinestro Corps in an attack on the Green Lantern Mogo in Space Sector 2261. By eliminating Mogo, the <a href=\"\/green-power-ring\/4055-41361\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">Green Lantern rings<\/a> would not be able to locate successors should their wielders be killed.<\/p><p>Ranx wanted revenge upon Guy Gardner and would not strike until promised by <a href=\"\/enkafos\/4005-51906\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51906\">Enkafos<\/a> that he would indeed have his revenge. Using the power of Ranx's gravity disruptors, the Sinestro Corps carved deep inside Mogo to get to the power ring at his core. Ranx believed wrongly that Mogo was hiding Guy Gardner from his wrath. A number of Lobe Spawn travelled through the tunnel carved by Ranx in order to sacrifice their lives to destroy the planet-form Green Lantern. They, in turn, were stalled by members of the Green Lantern Corps.<\/p><p>While most fought on and around Mogo, a small strike force of Green Lanterns was sent against Ranx. The Lanterns discovered that, in his rage, Ranx was overloading his gravity disruptors. This threatened to lose control of the disruptors\u2019 power source, a subspace link to a grade four black hole. The gravitational feedback would destroy everything within a two light year radius.<\/p><p>One of the Green Lanterns that stormed Ranx central command was Chthos-Chthas Chthatis. Ranx recognized the Lantern from their previous encounter, angering him even more. Chthos-Chthas Chthatis was slain by Enkafos, while Green Lantern <a href=\"\/stel\/4005-47279\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47279\">Stel<\/a> of Grenda attempted an interface with Ranx central processor. As fast as Stel reduced the power flux, Ranx increased it. Once the Guardians rewrote the <a href=\"\/book-of-oa\/4015-50651\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50651\">Book of Oa<\/a> to allow the Lanterns to wield lethal force against Sinestro and his allies, Enkafos was cut down by Sodam Yat of Daxam. Yat took over for Stel and told his fellow Lanterns to go, then he destroyed Ranx.<\/p><p>Despite being outnumbered, the Green Lanterns had managed to turn the tide of battle. The Children of the White Lobe were either captured or dead, as were the members of the Sinestro Corps who had not withdrawn. At this time it appears there is nothing left of Ranx, though it is not improbable that he might somehow be restored in the future.<\/p><p>Ranx has been resuscitated and restructured. He controls War World and has the ability to send out Yellow Manhunters during massive battles.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-134743\/","id":134743,"name":"Escapist Entertainment \/ Mercenary! \/ Old Man Lantern \/ Tygers","issue_number":"2"},"gender":0,"id":51907,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/887390-bleez004.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/887390-bleez004.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/887390-bleez004.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/887390-bleez004.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/887390-bleez004.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/887390-bleez004.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/887390-bleez004.jpg"},"name":"Ranx","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-3\/","id":3,"name":"Alien"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-10\/","id":10,"name":"DC Comics"},"real_name":"Ranx","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/ranx\/4005-51907\/"},{"aliases":"Skippy The Jedi Droid","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-52043\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":6,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:25:02","date_last_updated":"2015-12-19 10:15:16","deck":"R5-D4 is an R5 series astromech droid who was nearly purchased by Luke Skywalker rather then R2-D2","description":null,"first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-17616\/","id":17616,"name":"Star Wars","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":52043,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/326025-100551-r5-d4.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/326025-100551-r5-d4.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/326025-100551-r5-d4.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/326025-100551-r5-d4.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/326025-100551-r5-d4.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/326025-100551-r5-d4.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/326025-100551-r5-d4.jpg"},"name":"R5-D4","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-5\/","id":5,"name":"Robot"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-364\/","id":364,"name":"Dark Horse Comics"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/r5-d4\/4005-52043\/"},{"aliases":"I-45ENG\/NTH SERIES","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-52160\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":14,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:24:58","date_last_updated":"2013-05-10 18:33:03","deck":"Babbage is a representative of Robotica that joined the Legion Academy as a Cadet.","description":"<p>Babbage was a combat-class unit sent to join the new Legion Academy from the newly founded planet of Robotica, after the long war between machine intelligence and organic life.

In the anime Ash had received Pikachu a gift from <a href=\"\/professor-oak\/4005-58495\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58495\">Professor Oak<\/a>, while in the manga adaption '<a href=\"\/pokemon-the-electric-tale-of-pikachu\/4050-20952\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20952\">The Electric Tale of Pikachu<\/a>' Ash had found Pikachu under the floorboards of his house chewing on electric cables.

But eventually the flock of Spearow caught up causing Ash and Pikachu to fall off the bike. As pikachu lie helpless on the ground he looked up to see Ash using his body to shield it from the Spearow's attacks. Realizing that Ash truly cared about it, using the last of it's strength Pikachu leapt into the air and unleashed a massive lightningbolt, defeating the entire flock of Spearow and accidentally incinerating Misty's bike. As both Ash and Pikachu lie exosted on the ground Pikachu gives Ash a lick on the cheek, sealing their bond of eternal friendship. Shortly Pikachu fainted and frantic Ash continued to run towards the Pokemon Center.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13927\/323895-95817-ash-ketchum.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-323895\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.7475\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13927\/323895-95817-ash-ketchum.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-323895\"><img alt=\"Ash and Pikachu from the Anime Series\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13927\/323895-95817-ash-ketchum.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13927\/323895-95817-ash-ketchum.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ash and Pikachu from the Anime Series\" src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13927\/323895-95817-ash-ketchum.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13927\/323895-95817-ash-ketchum.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ash and Pikachu from the Anime Series<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When Ash finally reached the Pokemon Center he was immediately scolded by <a href=\"\/nurse-joy\/4005-58398\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58398\">Nurse Joy<\/a> for allowing his Pikachu to become so injured.

By the end of the battle when Mewtwo realized the error of his ways he took the Pikachu clone, along with the other clones, to find their true place in the world.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63099\/1998240-526px_ashachu.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1998240\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.138783269962\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63099\/1998240-526px_ashachu.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1998240\"><img alt=\"Ashachu\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" data-width=\"562\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63099\/1998240-526px_ashachu.png\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63099\/1998240-526px_ashachu.png 526w, http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/63099\/1998240-526px_ashachu.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ashachu\" src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63099\/1998240-526px_ashachu.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63099\/1998240-526px_ashachu.png 526w, http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/63099\/1998240-526px_ashachu.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" data-width=\"562\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ashachu<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>At one point during his travels through Johto <a href=\"\/ash-ketchum\/4005-51895\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51895\">Ash<\/a> was temporarily transformed into a Pikachu by a witch in training named Lily.

See while Giovanni funded the project all he cared about was owning the world's most powerful Pokemon, where as Fuji had agreed to do the experiment in hopes of finding a way of reviving his daughter. Even in it's suspended form Mewtwo showed great mental abilities sharing a connection with his fellow clones, and in their dreams the five had become friends. Unfortunately the cloning process was unstable, with Mewtwo being revealed to be the only one strong enough to with stand the process, and slowly the clones of Bulbasaur, Charmanger and Squirtle slipped away. This caused Mewtwo great distress as it could feel the essence of Amber faiding too. In the lab the scientists where in a panic as the distress to Mewtwo had caused it's mental abilities to reach critical levels, the only thing that calmed it down were Amber's last thoughts that Mewtwo must live, as life is a wonderful thing. In fear that the memories of Mewtwo would make it dangerous Dr. Fuji gave the orders to have it's mind wiped.<\/p><h4>Mewtwo Strikes Back<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19151\/382396-173206-mewtwo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-382396\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19151\/382396-173206-mewtwo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-382396\"><img alt=\"Mewtwo Reduces the Lab to Flames\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19151\/382396-173206-mewtwo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19151\/382396-173206-mewtwo.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mewtwo Reduces the Lab to Flames\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19151\/382396-173206-mewtwo.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19151\/382396-173206-mewtwo.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mewtwo Reduces the Lab to Flames<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In the present day Mewtwo is now full grown but still kept in suspended stasis, until for the first time since it's memory being wiped Mewtwo's mental energy peaks, breaking it's container and waking it up. Confused about where he was and what was going on Mewtwo questioned, \"where am I, who am I.\" Mewtwo had vague memories of something before now but could not remember, due to the memory loss. Dr. Fuji explained to Mewtwo how he was the result of the experiment they had been performing. Upon hearing this Mewtwo asked what would become of him now the experiment was over? However Fuji assured Mewtwo that the experiments were far from over and that Mewtwo was awake the real experiment could begin. Fuji then went to congratulate his colleagues leaving Mewtwo sitting in the broken test tube. Hearing what Dr. Fuji said Mewtwo questioned his existence was he merely put on this planet to be an experiment to be a science plaything.

They were: The <a href=\"\/stygian-starbender\/4005-53560\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53560\">Stygian Starbender<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ree\/4005-53729\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53729\">Ree<\/a>, Trantra of the Trill, and Robert Grayson also known as <a href=\"\/marvel-boy\/4005-2153\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2153\">Marvel Boy<\/a>.<\/p><p>After an exchange of energy blasts, Quasar merely put up an energy shield and then burst forth with foot long blunt end stakes and managed to down Marvel Boy. Then they assaulted Quasar with extremely sharp Quantum-weapons and he only just managed to escape their attack by defending himself with nunchucks, but realizes he\u2019s far too outnumbered. He flies off to put some distance between himself and the other Quantum-banders, which the three remaining consider the act quite cowardly.<\/p><p>Quasar attempts a \u201ctotal energy drain\u201d but is caught by surprise when they slam a pair of Quantum-slabs the size of trucks in an attempt to crush him. They briefly discuss which of them will win the honor of being the last Protector. Trapped, Quasar briefly considers giving up, but he overcomes it and manages to escape after hearing a call for help that sounds a great deal like Eon. He Quantum-Jumps into the Quantum-Zone and waits for them. He figures that if the \u2018background noise\u201d of the Q-Zone can cover what he is attempting then he stands a chance. He begins concentrating on his connection with all fourteen gems on the bands and opens them to their fullest. The three remaining Banders come and he surprises them by overloading their Quantum-Bands with too much power. They get disintegrated and Quasar returns to the Eonverse.<\/p><p>Much later, Quasar is <a href=\"\/ultimate-nullifier\/4055-40946\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40946\">nullified<\/a> during the Infinity War conflict and ends up in the White Room. It appeared to be some sort of purgatory, holding within it\u2019s curtained walls all the beings who had ever worn the Quantum-Bands. There he spoke with Glakandar who appeared to remember their earlier conflict which casts some doubt over if the Quantum-Banders that Thanos created were indeed duplicates and not the originals.<\/p><h2>Abilities of the Quantum Bands<\/h2><p><b>Energy Manipulation<\/b>: Primarily, the bands are tools for manipulating forms of energy. A bearer of the quantum-bands can affect, alter, absorb, and channel any form of energy found in the Electromagnetic spectrum, from Gamma Rays to Radio Waves, and this also includes visible light. Wendell Vaughn, the previous wearer, once absorbed and released the entire energy output of a star, funneling the radiation, and nuclear fusion, passing entirely through the bands. So great is the bands ability to absorb and control energy that most other energy manipulators (<a href=\"\/presence\/4005-11340\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11340\">Presence<\/a>, <a href=\"\/jack-of-hearts\/4005-7213\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7213\">Jack Of Hearts<\/a>, <a href=\"\/living-laser\/4005-9904\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9904\">Living Laser<\/a>\u2026 etc.) cannot come close to overwhelming the bands, only truly powerful energy manipulators (Silver Surfer, <a href=\"\/thanos\/4005-7607\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos<\/a>, or <a href=\"\/galactus\/4005-2149\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus<\/a>\u2026 etc.) are capable of such a feat. The energy output of the bands is generally appears to be yellow in color, but since the bands have mastery of the entire EM spectrum, presumably a wielder could change the color of the energy at will (since visible light is only a small fraction of the greater EM spectrum). It is believed that the energy defaults to yellow because the energy of the <a href=\"\/quantum-zone\/4020-44748\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44748\">Quantum-Zone<\/a> seems to be yellow in color.<\/p><p><b>Energy Constructs<\/b>: The bands can construct anything the wearer can imagine from \"Quantum energy\", This energy is derived from the Quantum-Zone, although the bands can absorb energy from all known sources. The more care the bearer takes in the creation of a construct, the stronger and more durable it is. A practiced bearer can alter the mass of the constructs so that they have the consistency of molasses or to be lighter than air. These constructs last indefinitely or until the bearer reabsorbs the construct into the Q-bands.<\/p><p><b>Flight<\/b>: The bands allow the bearer to fly in atmosphere or in space (surrounding the wearer in an energy aura to protect from air-friction or the vacuum of space), and can achieve incredible speeds (Wendell Vaughn once flew from New York Harbor to the Sea of Tranquility in under 5 minutes).<\/p><p><b>Teleportation<\/b>: they also enable the bearer to quantum jump or create apertures between the fabric of space\/time of various sizes. Allowing the wearer access to the realm of potential energy which the bands interface with known as the Quantum-Zone. A wearer can then travel through this trackless, featureless zone and emerge at a different point in our physical space light years away from his starting point only seconds later. His Quantum-bands would enable him to keep his bearings while in the zone and thus emerge where he wants to. He can cross countless light years in a single jump (Quasar regularly traveled from our star system to systems in other galaxies) if he so desires. Important note, however, she cannot quantum-jump within an atmosphere without ripping a hole in its ozone layer.<\/p><p><b>Communications<\/b>: The bands can detect, emit, and receive radio waves; thereby the bearer can communicate with other radio receivers. The bands can also create a \u201cQuantum-link\u201d which appears as a glowing golden sphere about 2 inches in diameter, which travels to the point of contact at warp speeds and connects with any communication device present allowing the bearer to carry on near-instantaneous communications even over extra-galactic distances.<\/p><p><b>Altered Metabolism<\/b>: One previous bearer of the Quantum bands(Marvel Boy) has been known to be able to augment his strength and stamina to unknown limits with the Quantum-bands. Quasar himself rarely exhibited this ability and only when it was needed. He once physically restrained <a href=\"\/she-hulk\/4005-1449\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk<\/a> by himself, whether this was a statement of his augmented physical strength or her own restraint is unknown, though she seemed to struggle against him.<\/p><p><b>Mental Protection<\/b>: Despite the fact that the Quantum-Bands have no control over the mind or Psionics, at least one previous bearer (Quasar) had \"programed\" the Bands to protect his mind for mental attacks and takeover. So powerful is this protection that neither powerful psychics, such as <a href=\"\/moondragon\/4005-7214\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon<\/a>, or the <a href=\"\/overmind\/4005-4812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4812\">Overmind<\/a> could overcome it.<\/p><p><b>Mental\/Physical Bond: <\/b>The Quantum Bands bond with their bearer upon contact interfacing with the bearer's mind allowing for mental control. Permanently affixing themselves generally to the bearer's wrists, the flesh and bone within rendered indestructible so long as the bond with the bands persists. The bond can only be broken upon the bearer's death, at which point the bands could be removed easily.<\/p><h2>Limitations<\/h2><p><b>Worthiness<\/b>: Similar to the hammer of Thor, a bearer of the Quantum-Bands must to be worthy. As the Quantum-Bands are tied to the station of the Protector of the Universe, the bands seem to require a calm mind lacking \u2018killer instinct\u2019 to learn to use them to their fullest potential. A bearer with the intent to commit acts of depravity and destruction will quickly find himself losing control of the energy output of the bands until they disintegrate him.<\/p><p><b>Magic<\/b>: The Bands cannot absorb it or resist it. However, an enchanted physical object will only be as strong as the object itself would otherwise be. Therefore, Thor's hammer (<a href=\"\/mjolnir\/4055-40971\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir<\/a>) will simply not shatter Quasar's forcefield like glass. Fortunately, magicians have no control over the energies he manipulates so, it evens out.<\/p><p><b>Extradimensional energy<\/b>: Quasar is susceptible to all persons using Darkforce. His Q-bands cannot create constructs to hold or resist darkforce energy. The Darkforce penetrates his energy like it wasn't even there. Also entities from the Negative-Zone (such as Annihilus) can corrupt the bands if wearing them.<\/p><p><b>Kinetic Energy<\/b>: The Quantum Bands have no defense against someone manipulating it psionically. (Which is why Maelstrom overwhelmed Quasar so easily to begin with), but a bearer can resist a kinetically imbued object (sich as a knife or a deck of cards) If a bearer of the Quantum Bands senses the attack they can throw up a shiled to defend themselves with.<\/p><p><b>Psionic energy<\/b>: A psionic blast will cut through any quantum constructs like papier mache'. Fortunately, most psionic manipulators are susceptible to the energies of the Quantum-Bands, so it evens out.<\/p><p><b>Matter manipulation<\/b>: Foes who manipulate matter, psionically or otherwise, the Quantum Bands cannot effect their powers. They deal with energy, not matter. The Molecule Man, Sersi, Phoenix, Her, and the Silver Surfer, among others, affect matter in a way that a bearer of the Q-bands cannot. However, Her, Sersi, and the Silver Surfer use cosmic energy to power their matter manipulation abilities and therefore a practiced bearer could affect the energy source, but not the ability itself.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-31879\/","id":31879,"name":"Destiny Amidst The Ruins","issue_number":"2"},"gender":0,"id":53732,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/371085-47749-trantra.gif","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/371085-47749-trantra.gif","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/371085-47749-trantra.gif","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/371085-47749-trantra.gif","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/371085-47749-trantra.gif","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/371085-47749-trantra.gif","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/371085-47749-trantra.gif"},"name":"Trantra","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-3\/","id":3,"name":"Alien"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/trantra\/4005-53732\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-53733\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":5,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:25:07","date_last_updated":"2016-05-09 11:19:23","deck":"Deoxys is a legendary pokemon from space.\n\nIt first appeared in the seventh pokemon movie: POKEMON DESTINY DEOXYs.

Only a few can wear it. After matoro sacrificed his life to save it. The mask created a body and became a Toa.","description":"<h2>The Beginning\u00a0<\/h2>\u00a0Over 100,000 years ago, near the creation of the Bionicle Universe, the Mask of Life was created by the Great beings who made the mask so that Mata Nui could restore life if it needed to be restored. \u00a0The mask of life was looked inside of a box, so that when the time was right it could be used. However a great being became curios of the mask, and opened the box. The mask reacted and gave the being power to give life to anything. Because of this it also gave nov-living things life, and it also gave the things that were non-living minds of there own. The Great beings then confined him so that he could not make anything come to life. So after the Beings were forced to hide the mask again, this time under mount valmai. Where they sent protectors to watch the mask named \"The Order Of Mata Nui\".\u00a0 <br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Some time, a group called the Piraka sought out the Mask of Life to rule the Matoran Universe. Meanwhile, the Toa Nuva wanted it to heal Mata Nui. The Mask fused with the Piraka known as Vezon, granting him the power to absorb kinetic energy and see into the future. It also gave Vezon a giant spider named Fenrak. However, Vezon was too evil and insane for the Mask of Life's taste. Instead, the Mask wanted the Matoran known as Matoro to be its new guardian. Later, Matoro became one of the Toa Inika and helped defeat Vezon and separate the Mask of Life from him. Later, the Mask went into the area known as the Pit. It's mutagenic waters were causing the Mask to crack. It was sought by the banished warriors known as the Barraki. Meanwhile, a Matoran named Deckar thought the Mask was too dangerous and tried to destroy it. Desperately, the Mask turned Deckar into the being named Hydraxon and the Toa Inika into the Toa Mahri. After a long and vicious battle, Matoro used the Mask's power to bring Mata Nui back to life at the cost of his own. After matoro died, the mask found itself in the swamp ares of Kardi Nui. There, it decidd that it would fight instead of relying on guardians to do so. It made a body and weapons for iself and aided the Toa Nuva in the battle against the Makuta. It defeated the one named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55445\" href=\"\/icarax\/4005-55445\/\">  Icarax<\/a> by devolving him back into a biomechanical being. As Ignika guarded Icarax, the Makuta revealed that Ignika had a countdown function. If the Toa did not defeat the Makuta, then Ignika would be forced to drain all life out of the Matoran Universe. Later, the Ignika gave up his new body to help speed up the process to wake up Mata Nui.\u00a0 <br \/>\u00a0<br \/>While the Mask of Life is genderless, it likes to be seen as a boy in honor of Matoro. The Toa Ignika acts as a guarded child at times, and often acts on its emotions.
