He accompanies Michael Jon Carter 500+ years in the past to help him in becoming the superhero Booster Gold.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>Skeets was the security <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/robots\/4015-56059\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56059\">robot<\/a> at the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/metropolis\/4020-41184\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\">Metropolis<\/a>: <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/space-museum\/4020-57164\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57164\">Space Museum<\/a> where <a href=\"\/booster-gold\/4005-1786\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold<\/a> worked as a janitor. After Booster Gold decided to steal the artifacts to make himself into a superhero, he <a href=\"\/time-travel\/4015-55712\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55712\">traveled to the past<\/a> where Skeets joined him. Skeets often provides a sense of forewarning as he has excellent files on past events (which are present events for everyone else.) Note that although genderless Skeets is generally given a male gender representation.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>His first appearance was in <a href=\"\/booster-gold-1-the-big-fall\/4000-26451\/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-26451\"><em>Booster Gold #1<\/em><\/a> in 1986. He was created by Dan Jurgens.<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><p>Despite being a robot, Skeets is often seen to exhibit a sense of humour. As a <a href=\"\/robots\/4015-56059\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56059\">robot<\/a> though he does not really undergo much development as a character though he has been shown to be highly loyal to Booster and his family. During the events of <a href=\"\/52\/4045-40798\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40798\">52<\/a>, he did change personality, but this was as a result of the influence of <a href=\"\/mr-mind\/4005-9336\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9336\">Mister Mind<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><p>Skeets served as the constant sidekick to Booster Gold though generally not when Booster served with the <a href=\"\/justice-league\/4060-55928\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55928\">Justice League<\/a>. Thus his stories have generally been restricted to series focusing solely on Booster.<\/p><p>The most important story involving Skeets unfolded during the 52 story arc. At the beginning of the story Skeets begins to malfunction and is acting differently than usual in his ability to predict events. Despite being examined by <a href=\"\/will-magnus\/4005-9536\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9536\">Doctor Magnus<\/a> everything is seemingly operational with him, but he begins to exhibit weird behavior. He seems very interested in gaining access to <a href=\"\/rip-hunter\/4005-4937\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4937\">Rip Hunter<\/a> time lab, and especially so after Booster\u2019s apparent death. Unknown to Skeets though, Booster faked his death because he had been able to ascertain from Rip\u2019s <a href=\"\/rip-hunters-blackboard\/4055-55647\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55647\">blackboard<\/a> as to what was happening. Skeets begins a hunt for Rip Hunter and eventually when he finds him he discovers that Booster is alive and working with Rip in the city of <a href=\"\/kandor\/4020-41290\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41290\">Kandor<\/a>. Skeets attacks them, but Booster unleashes the <a href=\"\/phantom-zone\/4020-42370\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone<\/a> on him which has the unforeseen effect of being consumed by Skeets. The two heroes escape but soon have a showdown with Skeets as it is revealed that Mister Mind has had control of him since the beginning of the story. Mister Mind seeks to use the knowledge of Rip to control the new 52 worlds which resulted from the events of <a href=\"\/infinite-crisis\/4045-40765\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis<\/a>. Skeets eventually is able to capture Mister Mind and journeys through the time stream to destroy him. This act of sacrifice is short lived as it is revealed that his memory was backed up one year previously and only a new body must be created for him.<\/p><p>In the following time a new group of time travelers is assembled including himself, Booster, Rip and Booster\u2019s sister <a href=\"\/goldstar\/4005-47689\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47689\">Michelle<\/a>. They now battle a group of villains known as the <a href=\"\/time-stealers\/4060-55819\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55819\">Time Stealers<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>As a robot Skeets is not subject to most of the physiological problems that most humans would be. Also he has the ability of flight and due to his databanks, an extensive knowledge of past (or current) events. In addition to this he also has a selection of weapons and tools kept in the interior of his shell, Skeets has also demonstrated the ability to produce blasts of blue energy.<\/p><h2>Other Media<\/h2><p>Skeets has appeared alongside Booster in episodes of <em>Batman: The Brave and the Bold<\/em> and <em>Justice League Unlimited<\/em>.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-26451\/","id":26451,"name":"\"The Big

It first appeared in \"<a href=\"\/the-uncanny-x-men\/4050-3092\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3092\">Uncanny X-Men\" #191<\/a> (March, 1985). The Omega Sentinels of this reality had killed or imprisoned most of the Super Heroes\/Mutants in the Northern United States, but a few continued to evade capture (e.g. Wolverine). Project: Nimrod, a plan to create a new generation of Sentinels, more powerful, efficient and unstoppable. Nimrod was the prototype for the next generation. It was prematurely activated when <a href=\"\/kitty-pryde\/4005-3548\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Katherine Anne \"Kate\" Pryde<\/a> and <a href=\"\/rachel-summers\/4005-3566\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel Summers<\/a> infiltrated the Project. Nimrod initially convinced it had witnessed the termination of the two intruders, halted it's assault. Kate, saved Rachel after initiating a Post-hypnotic command (a contingency plan) with the assistance of the Phoenix Force, boosting Rachel's latent secondary mutation, which thrust Rachel into the Timestream. Kate (she later merged with a Sentinel monitor unit, drifted in time, drawn (eventually) to a bodiless metallic head that would later be known as Widget).<\/p><p>Nimrod mechanically attempted to repeat the time-travel process used by Rachel, But found itself travelling aimlessly in the timestream. According to \"New X-Men\" #29, vol.2 (October, 2006), Nimrod first emerged on Earth-61029, (19 years prior to its own time period). This Earth was similar enough to it's own, for Nimrod to use it's records on various mutants to track them down. It located <a href=\"\/forge\/4005-4279\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge<\/a> in <a href=\"\/eagle-plaza\/4020-55844\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55844\">Eagle Plaza<\/a>, Dallas, Texas. In this reality, Forge was married to <a href=\"\/storm\/4005-1444\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm<\/a>\/Ororo Munroe and had two children with her, Naze and Orora Munroe. Nimrod slew Storm and took the children hostage, convincing Forge to provide it with a functional time device. Forge incorporated one within it's system, but never informed the Sentinel it's temporal jumps would be erratic. Nimrod was again lost in the timestream.<\/p><p>According to flashbacks in \"New X-Men\" #20, vol.2 (January, 2006) and #26 (July, 2006), Nimrod found itself on Earth 616 (mainstream Marvel-Earth) several months before <a href=\"\/m-day\/4015-41003\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day<\/a> and about 16 years before it's activities on Earth-61029. It emerged in front of <a href=\"\/william-stryker\/4005-40564\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">William Stryker<\/a> who had lost his faith and contemplated suicide. Stryker decided Nimrod was a gift from God, and his faith was restored. According to \"X-Force\" #1, vol.3 (April, 2008), events documented in Nimrod's database coincided with those of Earth-616. Discovering several irreconcilable differences between it's historical database (from Earth-811) and new information from Earth-616, Nimrod was unable to process the differences, and shut down.<\/p><p>Stryker had Nimrod partially dismantled in order (to render it controllable and) to access its databanks. Nimrod's back-up systems and self-diagnostic routine came online and noticed damage. The robot assessed it's situation and concluded that \"self-preservation\" should become it's Primary objective, but was unable to do much in it's dismantled state. Stryker pulled information from its databanks to learn the history of Earth-811 and \"predict\" similar events occurring on Earth-616. He used Nimrod's records of future obituaries to rescue various people and their families from their imminent demise. He then recruited the grateful individuals to his new militia, the '<a href=\"\/purifiers\/4060-14915\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\">Purifiers<\/a>'. Stryker used Nimrod's information to manipulate certain events to his own choosing and hunt down mutants he had Not been aware of. Unbeknown to him, Nimrod was able to falsify some \"facts\" in order to manipulate Stryker itself.<\/p><p>In the present portion of \"New X-Men\" #26, vol.2, Nimrod directed Stryker to attack <a href=\"\/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\/4020-41138\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier's Institute<\/a>. Being an 'unscheduled' action, Nimrod was counting on Stryker dying in the attack. In \"New X-Men\" #27, Nimrod managed to re-boot it's systems and slay the <a href=\"\/purifiers\/4060-14915\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\">Purifiers<\/a> assigned to guard it. It was still in need of repairs and traced the Forge of Earth-616 to Dallas. In \"New X-Men\" #28, Nimrod was able to coerce Forge to repair it's body on threat of teleporting to Africa and slaying the Storm of this reality (at that time marrying <a href=\"\/black-panther\/4005-1477\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther<\/a>\/T'Challa). In \"New X-Men\" #29, Nimrod failed to intercept a distress message from Forge to the Xavier Institute. With the X-Men attending Storm's wedding in <a href=\"\/wakanda\/4020-41027\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda<\/a>, the New X-Men answered the call instead. They included <a href=\"\/dust\/4005-4555\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\">Dust<\/a>, <a href=\"\/hellion\/4005-40454\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\">Hellion<\/a>, <a href=\"\/mercury\/4005-15078\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15078\">Mercury<\/a>, <a href=\"\/prodigy\/4005-40475\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\">Prodigy<\/a>, <a href=\"\/rockslide\/4005-40456\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40456\">Rockslide<\/a>, <a href=\"\/surge\/4005-40509\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\">Surge<\/a> and <a href=\"\/x-23\/4005-3560\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23<\/a>.<\/p><p>In \"New X-Men\" #30-31, Forge was in the process of uploading Nimrod's cybernetic mind to a new body (as a contingency) when the New X-Men stormed the laboratory. Nimrod was able to remotely control other robots present in the laboratory, directing them to attack the young mutants. Forge attempted to reprogram Nimrod, but the Sentinel quickly blocked the inventor's actions. Surge attacked Nimrod with multiple lightning strikes, which the Sentinel absorbed and used to power it's solid energy field. Nimrod managed to shatter Rockslide into myriad pieces, initially this action seemed tragic, but the mutant survived the trauma. Nimrod resisted the combined attacks of Hellion, Surge and X-23, managing to blast the former two. Prodigy shot at Nimrod with a rifle, hitting his target, but unable to damage it. Dust was able to divert it's attention while the others formulated an attack strategy. X-23 sliced open it's chest cavity, but (in retaliation) was burnt to a crisp (Elixir later used his powers to revive her). Surge drove her hands into Nimrod's chest, the robot was distracted at the time, electrocuting Mercury, this gave Surge enough time to overload Nimrod's time device, without the device anchoring It in the Present, Nimrod was sucked back into the Time vortex, travelling aimlessly.<\/p><p>Nimrod found itself drifting in the timestream with its databases (and memories) corrupted. At the end of the issue Nimrod found itself jumping to the point of its \"arrival\" in Uncanny X-Men #191, devoid of any recollection of it's previous activity since departing Earth-811.<\/p><p>In #191, Nimrod arrive on Earth-616 at a point, 35 years prior to it's own creation. It saved <a href=\"\/jamie-rodriguez\/4005-31381\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31381\">Jaime Rodriguez<\/a>, (a fish porter) from a mugger. As seen in UXM #189 (January, 1985), the original outcome had Rodriguez Not surviving the incident. The necklace he carried on his person would release the spirit of <a href=\"\/kulan-gath\/4005-19942\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19942\">Kulan Gath<\/a> and allow the Hyborian sorcerer to take over Manhattan. Instead Nimrod's intervention led to the loss of the necklace and continued imprisonment for the sorcerer.<\/p><p>By #193 (May, 1985), Nimrod had assumed humanoid form (Nicholas Hunter) and moved in with Rodriguez and his family. He helped young <a href=\"\/tomas-rodriguez\/4005-61948\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61948\">Tomas Rodriguez<\/a>, (son of Jaime) with his homework and forged a friendship with the boy. He then used the computer of his young 'friend' to find out more about the reality It was in, comparable to it's own. It Now considered It's Prime Directive, to be the \"Protection of Humanity\" through the extermination of Mutants. When a television News bulletin reported <a href=\"\/juggernaut\/4005-1445\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut<\/a> being active in New York City again, Nimrod's Directive initiated.<\/p><p>In #194 (June, 1985), Juggernaut was maintaining a low profile, using his civilian guise to visit the National United Bank and take care of his finances there. However, this did not prevent the <a href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men<\/a> and Nimrod from tracking him down. Nimrod considered both Cain and the X-Men, (<a href=\"\/colossus\/4005-1460\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus<\/a>, <a href=\"\/nightcrawler\/4005-1461\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler<\/a>, <a href=\"\/jean-grey\/4005-3552\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Phoenix<\/a>, <a href=\"\/rogue\/4005-1446\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue<\/a>, <a href=\"\/kitty-pryde\/4005-3548\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Shadowcat<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine<\/a>) to be dangerous criminals and attacked them on sight. It's initial blasts on Juggernaut, Phoenix and Shadowcat proved ineffectual. It managed to burn Cain's civilian clothing, but failed to effect either his body or his uniform, due to the Ruby of Cyttorack's influence (the source of his power). Cain donned his protective helmet and prepared for a fight. Rachel shielded herself and Kitty from the blast, giving the latter enough time to phase them away from the front line. Nimrod knocked Cain clear across the street to an abandoned construction site, intending to isolate the \"criminal\" away from civilians. It collapsed a building on Cain, from which, Juggernaut simply emerged unharmed.<\/p><p>Next, Nimrod strategically blasted Colossus and Nightcrawler, extrapolating the latter's teleportation destinations beforehand. It knocked both of them out, leaving the X-Men leaderless (Kurt was the team-leader at that time). Rogue threw Wolverine at Nimrod with a \"<a href=\"\/fastball-special\/4015-41709\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41709\">fastball special<\/a>\", but Logan's <a href=\"\/adamantium\/4055-40759\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">adamantium<\/a> claws could Not penetrate Nimrod's energy field. Wolverine was hurled into a wall, and dropped to the floor concussed. Nimrod then focused on Cain again. A physical blow to Juggernaut's head managed to dislodge his helmet. His opponent's head NOW open to direct attack, Nimrod incapacitated him with a tight beam of Ultra High Frequency sonics. Next, Shadowcat tried to scramble his nervous system (believing Him to be an armoured assailant), upon doing so, She realised Nimrod was a robot, just before it's energy field stunned her and sent her flying. Phoenix telekinetically collapsed the entire construction structure onto Nimrod, But It's Energy field protected It, and It commenced to dig It's way out of the rubble. This delaying tactic gave Rogue enough time to absorb the powers of Colossus, Nightcrawler and Shadowcat. Colossus' strength proved ineffectual on the Sentinel, but Rogue managed to teleport away .... along with Nimrod's arm. Severely damaged and it's systems scrambled, Nimrod had trouble defending itself from further physical attacks by Rogue. Nimrod had to retreat to allow it's self-repair systems to restore it's missing arm.<\/p><p>By #197 (September, 1985), Nimrod had improved it's \"Morphing\" ability to resemble a more Human guise, a fully human appearance and started working as a fish porter himself. It celebrated the completion of it's first working week at a pub with Jaime. Then two gunmen entered the pub and attempted to rob it. Nimrod returned to it's robotic form, and disintegrated both men with an energy blast. Jaime was disturbed but the rest of the crowd started cheering for Nimrod, congratulating the new \"Hero\".<\/p><p>By #208 (August, 1986), Nimrod had started monitoring mutant and other superhuman activity in New York City, focusing it's attention on the Avengers and the <a href=\"\/hellfire-club\/4060-13357\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club<\/a>. It noted the familiar mutant signature of Phoenix, (appearing weakened), Rachel having been stabbed by Wolverine, and decided to attack her before she recovered. Tomas asked his friend to check his homework, but Nimrod promised to do it later as he had some \"business\" in town. Nimrod contemplated briefly that It enjoyed teaching Tomas, despite neither joy nor teaching being within the perimeters of It's program. Nimrod found Rachel, once in proximity, it Also registered other Mutant signatures (Colossus, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Shadowcat, Storm and Wolverine), <a href=\"\/morlocks\/4060-3191\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3191\">Morlocks<\/a> (<a href=\"\/caliban\/4005-9637\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\">Caliban<\/a>, <a href=\"\/callisto\/4005-3423\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3423\">Callisto<\/a>) and Hellfire Club members (Black Bishop\/ <a href=\"\/harry-leland\/4005-3555\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3555\">Harold Leland<\/a>, Black Queen\/ <a href=\"\/selene\/4005-2176\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\">Selene<\/a>, Black King\/ <a href=\"\/sebastian-shaw\/4005-2175\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2175\">Sebastian Hiram Shaw<\/a>, Black Rook\/ <a href=\"\/friedrich-von-roehm\/4005-29764\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29764\">Friedrich von Roehm<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sage\/4005-4559\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4559\">Tessa<\/a>) also approaching It's target. It decided to attack ALL Fourteen mutants at once.<\/p><p>In #209 (September, 1986), Rogue threw Shaw to Nimrod strategically in hope of incapacitating the most physically powerful of the Hellfire Club. Nimrod estimated It's Obvious attack strategy would not harm Shaw, and So opted to reverse Shaw's \"gravimetric polarity\". Shaw was instantly repelled from the Earth's surface, quickly reaching escape velocity. Nimrod proved immune to Selene's power over inanimate objects. She changed tactics and attacked the Sentinel with boulders, but they were easily disintegrated. Callisto fired a grenade at the Sentinel, but it bounced off it's energy shield. The robot engaged in aerial combat with Rogue (who also had Collossus' powers at the time). It tried to blast her, but struck von Roehm instead, incinerating him. Nimrod, shifting It's attack strategy, unleashed It's shock-webs at Rogue, dropping her from the sky. Leland used his powers to maximize Nimrod's mass, forcing the robot to divert power from all it's systems, just to stay aloft. Nimrod tried to blast Leland but all it's attacks were ineffectual due to Selene's intervention. Nightcrawler decided to use the same method that had defeated Nimrod in their previous battle. However Nimrod initiated countermeasures and disrupted the teleportation process, the backlash sent Nightcrawler to an unknown location.<\/p><p>Nimrod was finally forced to sink to the ground. Colossus, out of action since the previous issue, recovered enough to emerge from the ground and take hold of Nimrod's leg. The combined efforts of Black Rook's and Colossus' assault began to take their toll on Nimrod's resources. Shadowcat, ceased the opportunity to phase through the Sentinel's body and disrupted its electrical systems. Colossus used judo attacks to drop Nimrod. Immobilised while trying to initiate it's self-repair process, Nimrod's progress was further hindered by Selene who was utilising every object in the vicinity to attack Nimrod. The Hellfire Club were executing a strategy planned by Tessa. Leland pushed His power to it's limits, reaching out to Shaw and gave him the mass of a small meteor. With ever-increasing momentum Shaw plummeted, finally hitting Nimrod with such force, Nimrod was strewn upon the ground in multiple pieces. Wolverine, mostly a spectator in this battle, wanted to further destroy the fragments of the robot before they had the opportunity to self-repair. However the fragments teleported away before anyone had a chance to touch them. (Unknown to Nimrod and the others, Rachel had been captured by Spiral while they were fighting).<\/p><p>By #246 (July, 1989), Nimrod had taken the human identity of \"Nicholas Hunter\", He was employed as the foreman of an explosives crew, working on a building site. On the side, Nicholas was acting as a vigilante, hunting drug dealers and executing them on the spot by disintegration. He \"tagged\" the scenes of his activities with an \"N\" burned into the walls. Nicholas used the money acquired from the deceased drug dealers to do \"community work\". On one day, He came upon a module of vaguely familiar technology. \"He\" picked it up and found \"His\" systems being subjugated by Master Mold, the module was a remnant of the Alpha Sentinel. Master Mold, having taken over Nimrod's body, began to re-create itself and to attack Rogue, the X-Woman closest to its vicinity, and incapacitated her. Sharon Kelly attempted to help the heroine stand up and was killed by Master Mold.<\/p><p>In #247 (August, 1989), Nimrod could only attempt to resist full integration while <a href=\"\/master-mold\/4005-10254\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10254\">Master Mold<\/a> fought the X-Men. Nimrod tried to convince Master Mold that both had transmuted and had become more than machines, evolved, sentient, effectively \"Mutating\". Nimrod determined they had No right to exist as THEY were Mutated and initiated Self-Destruction by hurling itself towards the <a href=\"\/siege-perilous\/4055-40957\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40957\">Siege Perilous<\/a>, taking Rogue with them. According to \"Machine Man\/Bastion '98\" the forces within the Siege Perilous judged the combined entity and restored it to life in a new form, humanoid but with no memory. The new entity later used the name \"<a href=\"\/bastion\/4005-40568\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40568\">Bastion<\/a>\".<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>Nimrod is made of highly durable material. It's self-repair program allows it to survive heavy damage and even restore itself on the molecular level. It possesses superhuman strength, sufficient to face Juggernaut as an equal. It's strength has been estimated in the range of c. 100 tons. It's body contains advanced computer systems. It has scanning systems that allow the Sentinel to track mutants and other super-humans, analyzing the nature of their powers. Nimrod can adapt it's form and abilities to those of its opponent(s). It actively works on counter-measures, always learning from previous encounters. It uses powerful concussive, plasma and disintegration blasts in battle. It's magnetic energy allows it to levitate tons of iron and steel, although this is mostly used as a defensive ability. It's \"shock-web\" uses unidentified energy to incapacitate opponents. It can reverse the gravity fields of others. It's forcefields protect Nimrod from most physical and energy assaults but they can be only maintained when it's energy reserves are sufficiently high. Nimrod has time-traveled on several occasions but is unfortunately unable to focus on exact co-ordinates, an inconsistency it has tried to rectify in it's past.<\/p><h2>In Other Media<\/h2><h3>Film<\/h3><h4>X-Men: Days of Future Past<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4148790-nimrod.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4148790\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4148790-nimrod.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4148790\"><img alt=\"The future Sentinel model\" src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4148790-nimrod.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4148790-nimrod.jpg 600w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4148790-nimrod.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4148790-nimrod.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>The future Sentinel model<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The future Sentinels seen in <a href=\"\/x-men-days-of-future-past\/4025-1549\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1549\"><em>X-Men: Days of Future Past<\/em><\/a> were heavily inspired by Nimrod, though are not named as such.

This similarity was noticed by <a href=\"..\/..\/wolverine\/29-1440\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Wolverine<\/a> when Onslaught claimed to be Charles Xavier. Wolverine remarked that he looked more like Magneto, with the helmet, build, and color scheme. These statements made Onslaught very angry, and he then released a huge amount of energy, destroying the room they were all in. He then proceeded to kidnap <a href=\"..\/..\/jean-grey\/29-3552\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Jean Grey<\/a> and took her to the astral plane. He tried to convince her to join him and his cause but without revealing that he was part of Xavier\u2019s subconscious. Onslaught then tries to show Jean Xavier\u2019s repressed frustration cause by his love for Jean. As a result he attacks Jean and burns his name psionically on Jean\u2019s forehead, which only Jean can see. Onslaught then throws Jean out of the astral plane. Jean and the X-Men later meet up with <a href=\"..\/..\/juggernaut\/29-1445\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Juggernaut<\/a> who asked Jean to search through his mind telepathically to find out who Onslaught was. She took him down into a telepathic proof room where they could sit and talk. Jean placed her hands on Juggernaut's head, and proceeded to look for information, which led to her discovering that Onslaught knew where they were. However, Juggernaut ran, and once in the hallway, found himself in a maze of stairs, and found only a door in which to escape. He ran through the door, only to find a massive Onslaught on the other side. Onslaught tore the <i>Gem of<\/i> <a href=\"..\/..\/cyttorak\/29-24949\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>Cyttorak<\/i><\/a> from Juggernaut's impenetrable body, and he would soon be kidnapped by Onslaught. Later, back in Xavier's body, Onslaught called the X-Men into his study. He claimed that he wanted to destroy the human race to leave the mutants supreme. Jean, distressed at what Xavier was saying walked around the room, and saw the <i>Gem of Cyttorak<\/i> on the table, and inside was Juggernaut. Onslaught then proceeded in battling the X-Men and destroyed most of the school.

He is soon interrupted by <a href=\"..\/..\/invisible-woman\/29-2190\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Invisible Woman<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/thing\/29-2114\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Thing<\/a>, who manage to save Franklin. Franklin runs to <a href=\"..\/..\/counter-earth\/34-54572\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <i>Counter-Earth<\/i><\/a><i>,<\/i> but is followed by Onslaught.<\/p><p>Upon his arrival in <i>Counter-Earth<\/i>, Onslaught became larger, and gained his Magneto-like mask. He soon faced-off against the Avengers, and was presumed defeated when he fell into the ocean. The Avengers then began questioning the credibility of Franklin as he claimed to be the son of both Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman who on <i>Counter-Earth<\/i> are not married and do not have any children. Shortly after Onslaught possesses the Hulk and uses him to attack Thor to see which hero was more powerful. Onslaught switched between the two heroes, and ended up possessing Thor, striking Hulk with lightning. As the Onslaught possessed Thor was about to strike Hulk again, he dropped Mjolnir, no longer being worthy. Thus Onslaught switched back to Hulk, and punched Thor high into the atmosphere. As he then went to pick up the hammer, the Avengers arrived and a fight ensued. <a href=\"..\/..\/captain-america\/29-1442\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Captain America<\/a> then ordered Human Torch and <a href=\"..\/..\/iron-man\/29-1455\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Iron Man<\/a> to rescue Thor, telling them they had about sixty seconds before Thor reverted to his alter-ego. They managed to save him in the allotted time, and Johnny took Thor back to the <a href=\"..\/..\/baxter-building\/34-41454\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Baxter Building<\/a>, where Mister Fantastic had discovered that Franklin really was his son. Cap orders <a href=\"..\/..\/hawkeye\/29-1475\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hawkeye<\/a> to go and search for Onslaught, and confronts him that he knows that underneath Hawkeye's costume, is Wolverine. They continue the battle the possessed Hulk, where Cap is thrown into a building. Iron Man, still in the atmosphere, charges down at Hulk at full speed, hoping that Bruce would one day forgive him for this. He punches Hulk, knocking him unconscious. He and Cap then assess their next move, when Onslaught possesses Iron Man, and attacks Cap. Back at the <a href=\"..\/..\/avengers-mansion\/34-41036\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Avengers Mansion<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/rikki-barnes\/29-24272\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Rikki Barnes<\/a> is baby sitting Franklin, and they are about to eat breakfast, when <a href=\"..\/..\/loki\/29-4324\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Loki<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/executioner\/29-3517\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Executioner<\/a>, Scarlet Witch, <a href=\"..\/..\/enchantress\/29-7225\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Enchantress<\/a>, and <a href=\"..\/..\/ultron\/29-2242\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Ultron<\/a> V make them an offer to help defeat Onslaught. On a balcony, an invisible <a href=\"..\/..\/ant-man\/29-6774\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Ant-Man<\/a> and Invisible Woman reveal themselves and Sue refuses to let the villains cause Franklin any harm.<\/p><p>After a brief fight the villains then decide to work side-by-side to defeat the threat of Onslaught, but in the end it was Rikki \"Bucky\" Barnes who defeated him by using a Fantasticar to send them both through the Negative Zone barrier in Richard's lab, trapping them there. Franklin then returns home while Bucky found herself suddenly on Earth 616, and Onslaught seen floating outside the Area 42 prison in the Negative Zone.<\/p><h3>AXIS<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5354700-5243681508-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5354700\" data-ratio=\"0.74888888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5354700-5243681508-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5354700\"><img alt=\"Red Onslaught\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/5354700-5243681508-latest\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5354700-5243681508-latest 900w, http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/5354700-5243681508-latest 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Onslaught\" src=\"http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/5354700-5243681508-latest\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5354700-5243681508-latest 900w, http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/5354700-5243681508-latest 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Red Onslaught<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Following the death of Charles Xavier during the <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/avengers-vs-x-men\/4045-56674\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">AVX<\/a> crisis, the <a href=\"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/red-skull\/4005-2250\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull<\/a> exhumes his corpse and grafts part of his brain onto his own, giving him Xavier's psychic abilities.

consumed countless universes. He first noticed the 616 dimension after he got done consuming an entire reality. What caught his attention was the <a href=\"\/infinity-gauntlet\/4055-40945\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet<\/a> and the power it gave off during the <a href=\"\/infinity-gauntlet\/4045-42233\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42233\">Infinity Gauntlet affair<\/a>. He soon lost the energy signal it let off as it was taken away from <a href=\"\/thanos\/4005-7607\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\"> Thanos<\/a>. Hunger knew 616 was there, but he didn\u2019t know its exact location. Eventually when <a href=\"\/magus\/4005-14619\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14619\">Magus<\/a> used it, Hunger found 616 again although he soon found out he couldn\u2019t get it because this universe was \u201cspherical\u201d. This meant that it had to be open from both ways, inside and out. Hunger could open the out, while he needed a pawn to open the inside of this particular dimension. So Hunger tricked <a href=\"\/galactus\/4005-2149\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\"> Galactus<\/a> into thinking the vibration patterns of the <a href=\"\/infinity-gems\/4055-41041\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41041\">Infinity Gems<\/a> were the same as those he consumed from planets. This eventually led to Galactus going for the Gems and collecting them, falling right into Hunger's plot. Hunger would mentally influence Galactus into a building a device that would take away his need for consuming planets, but in reality it was a device being built to let Hunger into this reality. Hunger also mentally influenced Galactus' mind so he couldn\u2019t see logic as to what he was building.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>The Hunger was created by <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/jim-starlin\/4040-7922\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7922\">Jim Starlin<\/a> and first appeared in <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/thanos\/4050-20764\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20764\"><em>Thanos<\/em><\/a> #1.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Epiphany<\/h3><p>Hunger would then watch Thanos as he tried to make up for his past acts by helping the <a href=\"\/rigellians\/4060-13918\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13918\">Rigellians<\/a>, leading to Hungers comment \u201cSo it begins\u201d. Hunger then watched Thanos, Adam Warlock, and <a href=\"\/pip\/4005-13782\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13782\"> Pip<\/a> as they discussed their plan concerning Galactus about to consume the Rigellians world. Hunger then noticed a presence watching him. He then thought to himself not to pass this opportunity and started talking to who ever was watching him explaining his origins. He then goes back to watching Galactus and how he took the Soul Gem from <a href=\"\/adam-warlock\/4005-6805\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6805\"> Adam Warlock<\/a>. Despite Thanos' best attempts, Galactus overcame him and opened a portal letting the evil and powerful Hunger into the 616 dimension, where he immediately took control of <a href=\"\/galactus-ship\/4055-55839\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55839\">Galactus' ship<\/a> and leaked into the dimension. As he took control of Galactus ship he made it so it wouldn\u2019t shut down letting him in this reality freely. Thanos then tells Galactus to use his <a href=\"\/power-cosmic\/4015-41039\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41039\">Power Cosmic<\/a> on Hunger, which only worked for a few seconds as Hunger then adapted to it then absorbed it. Thanos then detonated several charges around Galactus ship, destroying it in an effort to shut down power to the portal through which Hunger was pouring. Thanos also found that Hunger was manually protecting the device keeping the portal open. Hunger commenced pouring into this dimension, quickly spreading, absorbing, and encompassing it. Hunger then taunted the two, thanking them for realizing him into this reality. He\u2019d keep pouring in the dimension absorbing more of it eventually leading to him covering the entire area Thanos and Galactus were at.<\/p><p>Hunger continued to taunt them as he then was intrigued Thanos still had a plan. Although what Hunger didn\u2019t know was Thanos had already set a time shut down to Galactus ship. Thanos also had seized one of the Gems that allowed Hunger to pour into the dimension. Hunger was not disconnected from his bulk but still strong enough to kill Thanos as he wanted to seize the Gem back and reopen the portal. Thanos already had teleported an abandoned planet to the area as he teleported off the planet leaving Hunger between the two planets as they smashed each other with unimaginable force. Thanos then assumed the threat was dead and gone so he left the scene. But what wasn\u2019t seen was Hunger at a few inches in height that survived the collision.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>Hunger is a vast being in size and very powerful, said to have eaten over 1000 realities. He also a very strong telepath, even influencing beings like Galactus to do his bidding from a distance of a whole other reality away. He is also very vulnerable when first coming into dimensions but eventually adapts and absorbs the oncoming attacks towards him. Hunger also taught himself how to speak 106 languages from the 616 dimension. He is also able to breach parallel dimensions with ease as if they were doors you could simply walk through but he had trouble with \u201cspherical\u201d dimensions.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-124492\/","id":124492,"name":"Epiphany!","issue_number":"1"},"gender":0,"id":13725,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/3122657-thanos_vol_1_6.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/3122657-thanos_vol_1_6.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/3122657-thanos_vol_1_6.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/3122657-thanos_vol_1_6.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/3122657-thanos_vol_1_6.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/3122657-thanos_vol_1_6.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/3122657-thanos_vol_1_6.jpg"},"name":"Hunger","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-3\/","id":3,"name":"Alien"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/hunger\/4005-13725\/"},{"aliases":"Living Dynamo\nMitch McCutcheon\nEnergy Man","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-13812\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":111,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:32","date_last_updated":"2013-12-12 08:00:20","deck":"Zzzax is an electromagnetic intelligent being that was created when stray bullets from terrorists caused an explosion that started a chain reaction in the atomic reactor of a nuclear power plant.
