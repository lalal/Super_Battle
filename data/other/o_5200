neither a mortal being nor a god, s\/he is the personification of desire itself. Desire is androgynous, appearing as the most beautiful person or being to anyone. His\/her skin is pale and his\/her eyes are gold. S\/he is not about love, s\/he is about wanting, and as such, can be treacherous, vindictive and cruel. His\/Her realm is \u201cthe Threshold\u201d, an immense statue of his\/herself standing in mists of sunset red. He\/she dwells in its heart.<\/p><p>Many, many eons ago, Desire and <a href=\"\/dream\/4005-11171\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11171\">Dream<\/a> were friendly, but when s\/he caused one of his love affairs to collapse they became nemeses. Desire found Dream to be \u201c\u2026rude and boorish, he\u2019s been stuffy and stupid and he thinks he knows everything. And there\u2019s just something about him that gets on my nerves\u201d and so after losing a competition between him\/herself, <a href=\"\/despair\/4005-40851\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40851\">Despair<\/a> and <a href=\"\/delirium\/4005-40852\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40852\">Delirium<\/a> vs. Dream over Emperor Norton I, Desire swore to make Dream shed family blood, bringing the wrath of the Furies upon him. S\/he attempted to do this by fathering a child on Unity Kinkaid, a woman who was supposed to be the Dream Vortex, an event that came along once in many eons that broke down all the barriers between dreamers in a world, destroying them and wrecking havoc on the Dreaming. Dream had been captured at this time and Kinkaid was many people affected with a sleeping sickness that took hold during his imprisonment. Unity gave birth while still unconscious and her daughter was adopted. The Vortex passed along the family line to Unity\u2019s granddaughter, Rose Walker. Dream was about to kill Rose when Unity, at the edge of death, took the Vortex back and died naturally, preventing the Vortex from coming into being and Dream from killing his own grandniece. He suspected Desire immediately, and threatened him\/her if s\/he ever interfered in his affairs again.<\/p><p>S\/he did not, but took some sadistic delight in watching Dream's romantic relationships fail. It was s\/he that taunted him into journeying into Hell to free the lover, Nada, whom he had condemned there for millennia after rejecting him. When Dream finally did shed family blood - setting into motion the events of his own destruction - it was not Desire\u2019s doing. Though s\/he felt s\/he should be pleased, s\/he felt sorry for him and was frightened.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-109860\/","id":109860,"name":"The Doll's House, Part 1: The Doll's House","issue_number":"10"},"gender":0,"id":40832,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/749044-2_desire.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/749044-2_desire.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/749044-2_desire.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/749044-2_desire.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/749044-2_desire.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/749044-2_desire.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/749044-2_desire.jpg"},"name":"Desire of the Endless","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-7\/","id":7,"name":"God\/Eternal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-521\/","id":521,"name":"Vertigo"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/desire-of-the-endless\/4005-40832\/"},{"aliases":"Unit-G\nThe Prototype\nunit-1\nSho Fukamachi\nOswald Risker\nAgito Makishima\nValkyrie\nSean Barker","api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-40917\/","birth":null,"count_of_issue_appearances":2,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:39","date_last_updated":"2016-03-09 00:27:59","deck":"The word \"Guyver\" refers to a specific being - the fusion of a human or (theoretically) a Zoaform with an alien bio-booster symbiote.

To them, it has all the connotations of a nuclear reactor suddenly deciding of its own accord to meltdown. The term expresses horror, loathing and perversion. Since Arcanfel is the only person who actually communicated with the Creators, this means the term came from him.<\/p><p>In truth, no-one knows what the Creators, who brought the symbiotes to Earth in the first place, called the units themselves. What is known is that the symbiote was not created on Earth, like humans and Zoaforms. It is an alien life-form, a parasite rather than a symbiote, that was \"tamed\" by the inclusion of a cybernetic control medal.<\/p><p>It appears that the main function of the unit is to \"bio-boost\" the body of the wearer, increasing its strength, longevity, allowing the host to function in virtually any environment and adding new functions, such as communication with all other bio-boosted organisms. If the Creators were not one race, but a conglomerate of races, such a symbiote would be invaluable.<\/p><p>Nothing is known about the original form of the symbiote. Its biology somewhat resembles the Terran parasite Sacculina . Its energy requirements seem to be voracious; when the control medal of Guyver Two was destroyed, the parasite immediately turned on its host and devoured him in a matter of seconds.<\/p><p>When part of Guyver One was separated from the control medal, it took a humanoid shape and instinctively sought to return to the rest of its organism. Strangely enough, it not only retained the form of its previous host, but seemingly also a semblance of his memories.<\/p><p>The control medal is a technological miracle, a crystalline computer that not only controls the functions of the symbiotic armor, but also acts as an artificial intelligence that can supplement the mind of the host or even replace it when the need arises. It also makes a complete back-up of the mind and body of the host, repairing any damage to his or her body - up to and including complete destruction of the body. As long as the control medal remains intact, the Guyver survives.<\/p><p>In its dormant form, the G-unit can survive for an unlimited time. Like primitive Earth organisms, the cells of the G-unit do not age with every division, and the control medal, which has no moving parts, also does not wear. Its energy source is extra dimensional and apparently inexhaustible.<\/p><p>A dormant G-unit appears as a flattened, circular object; like a very long length of fleshy wire (not unlike muscle fibers), wound tightly around a central spindle, upon which sits the control medal. Embracing the wire are six metallic \"clamps\", two different sets of three, set in two triangles. The whole somewhat resembles a land mine.<\/p><p>Exactly how the control medal selects its host is not known, but apparently it is enough that a sentient being closely approaches the control medal to activate it. Perhaps, touching the dormant unit activates a brainwave scanner, which then zeros in on the nearest complex brain.<\/p><p>Since only humans have merged with bio-booster symbiotes so far, we shall describe only a bio-boosted human.<\/p><p>The form of the Guyver, is rather insectoid. It consists of a soft body and a hard exoskeleton. The basic form of the Guyver remains human, although, it seems, with slightly elongated limbs. The entire body is covered by, and perhaps even suspended in, an organic body glove which still resembles the \"wire\" of the dormant unit. Smooth, segmented armor, which in texture somewhat resembles an eggshell, covers most of the vulnerable areas of the body, while allowing maximal freedom of movement. The Head is crowned with a single, swept-back horn or antenna; the face retains no human characteristics except for two large, opaque eyes. Besides that, a Guyver will also have two respiration units (typically, hexagonal ports on the cheeks) and a sonic oscillator in the form of two small, silvery spheres on its face. Although all units have the same color, each Guyver adopts a unique color scheme, which might be influenced by the psychological make-up of the host.<\/p><p>A human who has merged with a bio-booster symbiote has not only gained the ability to summon the armor at any time. The change is more profound; the symbiote is present in every cell of the host\u00b4s body. He or she will have two small groups of pock-mark like organisms on their shoulder blades - these act as communication devices both between the hosts and the armor, and between different Guyvers. Otherwise, a Guyver host will resemble the human being he or she was before their transformation, down to the scars they had before then. The armor itself \"travels along with them\" in its own tiny pocket dimension, like a fold in space, really, available immediately.<\/p><p>This is what happens when a host calls on the armor:<\/p><p>The host activates the psionic link with the armor, specifically the control medal. Usually, this intense call will be accompanied by a sort of \"kiai\", traditionally unique to the host (For instance, Fukamachi would cry \"Guyver!\" while Makishima would speak \"Bio-boost!\").<\/p><p>The dimensional wall is breached by the control medal, dragging the armor along. This causes a shockwave, which clears the host from anything that may get caught between the armor and his body.<\/p><p>Nobody understands why clothing is not affected by this, but it isn\u2019t.<\/p><p>The \"soft\" armor wraps itself around the host in the form of tendrils; these liquefy and merge into the flexible body-glove before solidifying again, all in a split second.<\/p><p>At the same time, the body of the host modifies itself; human organs, muscles, bones even, change shape or shrink away to be supplemented or replaced by the symbiote\u00b4s organs, muscles and bones.<\/p><p>The hard parts of the armor sink on and merge into the body glove.<\/p><p>Any excess air is expelled through the respirator units on the face, as a sort of warning or challenge to any opponents. The Guyver is ready to fight.<\/p><p>The functions of the Guyver are all-encompassing. Since the symbiote takes over the organic functions of the host, there is in theory no need to ever remove the armor, even to feed or relieve oneself. A Guyver can survive in any atmosphere or lack thereof, under almost any conceivable pressure. It can resist exposure to temperatures of thousands of degrees. It has resistance against acids and alkali compounds.<\/p><p>Even if it should happen that a Guyver is injured, it will regenerate itself in minutes. Depending on the energy reserves, even a lost limb or a critically damaged brain will be restored without any long-term consequences. The control medal \"saves\" all the host\u00b4s memories. The Guyver does not even appear to need raw material to regenerate its body; even when only the control medal was left of Guyver One, his entire body was regenerated in a matter of hours.<\/p><p>If the sheer, raw drive and ability to survive of a Guyver are intimidating, even more frightening is its array of deadly weapons.<\/p><p>A Guyver possesses a standard arsenal; its first and foremost weapon is of course it\u00b4s immense strength. A Guyver is approximately one hundred times as strong as the average human being, allowing him to run at hundreds of miles an hour, make seemingly impossible jumps and overcome even the strongest Zoanoids in a match of strength.<\/p><p>To supplement this enormous power, a Guyver possesses, in its limbs, inertia generators, which enhance the impact of a kick or punch far beyond (ten times, it is estimated) what they would be even with the enormous strength of the armor behind it. Flesh and bone are as flan and Styrofoam to it.<\/p><p>Positioned on its forearms, a Guyver has \"sonic swords\", organic blades, composed from thousands of micro-fine plates, layered on top of one another, each vibrating separately. The blades can change shape; this suggests that each of the layers of the sword is actually a single molecule, which can be folded up like a \"Jacob\u00b4s ladder\". So far, there has been nothing that the blades can\u00b4t actually cut - except another sonic sword.<\/p><p>On the forehead, directly above the control medal, sits a small, marble-like object like a staring eye. This is actually a laser, very powerful for its economic size. The \"head-beam\" can easily pierce a Zoanoid\u00b4s skin, or vaporize a bullet in mid-air.<\/p><p>As mentioned before, also located on the face are the small, silvery spheres of the sonic oscillator. Normally, they act as vocal synthesizers for the host, but their frequency and power output can be regulated to use them as a weapon. Not only can the \"sonic buster\" disable enemies by using infrasound or ultrasound, it can actually atomize them by emitting a vibration on the specific frequency of organic molecules, causing them to vibrate themselves apart.<\/p><p>Roughly where a belt buckle should be, sits a larger silvery sphere. This is the gravity control center, which not only allows the Guyver to make itself weightless or super-heavy, but also can generate a microscopic wormhole which is then converted into a devastating graviton pulse, which can punch neat, round holes in concrete walls or enemies. Also, by manipulating gravity, the Guyver can create a shield in front of themselves. However this occurred in the original animated series and it is unclear if it is canon.<\/p><p>Finally, the deadliest weapon by far is the \"Megasmasher\". This is located under the armored chest panels, which first have to be opened - this is usually done by hand, but specialized tendrils can also fulfill this function if the arms are disabled.<\/p><p>Once the chest panels are opened, viscous liquid lenses inflate to full size, bulging out like huge eyes, and charge up; this takes a few seconds, depending on the intensity of the blast, and can also be done with the panels still closed.<\/p><p>The blast, when released, accelerates all particles in its path to almost light speed. The lenses themselves actually only project energy; the material destructive effect is caused by a relatively faint blast of particles, which however move at such gigantic speed they tear anything and everything apart at a subatomic level. Literally nothing made of matter can survive this effect.<\/p><p>Typically, a full-power blast reduces everything in a fifteen foot wide, one-mile long shaft to ions. Lower power settings are also possible (and indeed necessary).<\/p><p>Even a human host can use these weapons with deadly effect; if the control medal switches to auto-defense mode, because the host is disabled, however, the Guyver truly becomes an unstoppable, merciless killing machine.<\/p><p>There are few opponents that can realistically take on a Guyver. No Zoanoid can hope to prove a real threat, and the same goes for most Hyper-Zoanoids. All Enzyme-types possess the means to injure and theoretically critically disable a Guyver, but even so, their power has always proven insufficient to defeat their more versatile enemy. Any Zoalord can take on a Guyver, although even their defenses cannot completely protect them from the Mega-smasher. The only being who does not have to fear a Guyver in battle at all, is Arcanfel himself.<\/p><p>The greatest weakness of the Guyver, then, is the host himself. It has been proven possible to make a host subconsciously reject the armor and thus render him helpless to summon its power. Unfortunately, the two active Guyvers have already proven capable of overcoming such a strategy - Fukamachi through determination, and Makishima because he does not allow himself emotional weaknesses.<\/p><p>Chronos originally retrieved three G-units from the only surviving Creator Ship on earth: the Relic under Mount Minakami in Japan. Archanfel, who presumably was in hibernation at the time, could not foresee the betrayal of two parties at once, and thus it could happen that even before Richard Guyot could apprehend the units, they were stolen by a rogue Zoanoid by order of Agito Makishima. Chronos agents managed to retrieve only one unit - the damaged one, which died with Guyver Two. The other units ended up as Guyver One and Guyver Three. Of course, now a means had to be found to remove the units from their hosts and return them to their dormant state. And found it was. By order of Dr.Shirai, a corrupt Chronos scientist operating under commander Guyot, Zoanoids retrieved a Unit Remover, as they had found the G-units, months before.<\/p><p>The Unit Remover is apparently a standard tool of the Creators. In case a unit or a host went rogue, the Remover could seperate host and unit, returning it to its dormant form. One of these tools was given to Archanfel, long ago, to neutralize the deadly Guyver Zero, but he had since returned it. Guyot now possessed one, the only one on Earth, and Archanfel wanted it. Both Zoalords desired a G-unit, because both had realized what the Creators had, untold millennia before: If a G-unit could make a normal human almost rival a Zoalord in power, what it could turn a Zoalord into was surely a being of divine power. Guyot desired power more than anything else - it was what had made him a Zoalord, it would be what would make him the supreme power.<\/p><p>Archanfel, for his part, needed a Guyver to regenerate his body, which had apparently sustained a critical injury when the Creators left him behind.<\/p><p>Both Zoalords vied for possession of the Remover, with Guyot finally using it on Guyver Three. Unfortunately, because of Agitos assault on guyot, he was forced to fire without charging fully. This allowed Agito to retain his grip on the unit, albeit with some real effort. Before Guyot could make another attempt, he was eliminated by Archanfel, and the Remover has since been missing, possibly destroyed in the fiery conflagration of Mount Minakami.<\/p><p>During this monumental event, both Guyvers turned their Megasmashers on Archanfel, only to have their weapons turned against them and nearly being destroyed. Now, Guyver One\u00b4s link with the Creator Ship proved crucial. In his final microseconds of consciousness, he desired more than anything else the power to oppose his superior enemy... and the control system of the Relic responded. First by teleporting him and Guyver Three to safety, and secondly by fitting him with a means to take on any Zoalord: the Gigantic Armor .<\/p><p>Later, Guyver Three discovered that he, too, could use the Gigantic Armor, in the form of the Gigantic Dark.<\/p><p>And thus, matters now stand. Against the uncountable hordes of Chronos now stand the two deadliest warriors the world has ever seen: the Guyvers.<\/p><h2>OFFICIAL GUYVERS<\/h2><h2>Guyver 00<\/h2><p>Guyver Zero was the first human to merge with a bio-booster symbiote. The combination was so terrifyingly powerful, and what is more, uncontrollable by the creators, that they not only had him destroyed, but left the Earth altogether and tried to destroy the planet.<\/p><p>Guyver Zero existed for maybe less than one hour. He almost immediately turned on his Creators although this is uncertain as to whether it was the human's will or the Unit in defensive mode. The Creators had the new Guyver fight a T-Rex, which it defeated very quickly, but could have been considered a threat by the Unit, leading it to attack further targets. Archanfel, by their command, separated the host and the bio booster-symbiote, and killed the host. We never learned his name.<\/p><h2>Guyver 01<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/24167\/989307-guyver_1_86008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-989307\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/24167\/989307-guyver_1_86008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-989307\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/24167\/989307-guyver_1_86008.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/24167\/989307-guyver_1_86008.jpg 640w, http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/24167\/989307-guyver_1_86008.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Guyver One is Sho Fukamachi , an ordinary high school student, who was merged with a bio-booster symbiote completely by accident. Chronos has attempted anything in their power to get the bio-weapon back... and thus turned Guyver One into one of their most deadly enemies.<\/p><p>Although Guyver One is probably the least powerful Guyver due to the nature of its host as it can be assumed that all Guyver Units have the same power levels so differences between them come predominantly from their Hosts, he is nevertheless a formidable opponent. He is also the warrior who successfully merged with a Creator-ship, and as a result created the Gigantic upgrade. This alone makes him unique.<\/p><h2>Guyver 02<\/h2><p>Guyver Two was Oswald Risker, a high-placed Chronos official who by accident (?) merged with the only bio-booster symbiote that was retrieved after the Malmot-incident. He set out to defeat Guyver One and retrieve the control-medal, but discovered too late that his own control-medal had sustained critical damage. He died horribly when his control medallions failed and his symbiotic armor turned on his own body consumed it; his disintegrating body was destroyed by Guyver One.<\/p><h2>Guyver 03<\/h2><p>Guyver Three is Agito Makishima , also a high school student, although of a higher class than Fukamachi. Unlike the other Guyvers, he merged with the final bio-booster symbiote deliberately. This move suits his personality, which craves power above anything else as he called himself Zeus to Chronos for he would take their Throne. He is the deadliest surviving Guyver, partly because his greater willpower enabled him to take control of the Gigantic unit from Fukamachi to merge with it himself, to become the deadliest warrior the world has ever seen: the Gigantic Dark. Deadly; yes, humane; questionable.<\/p><p>In what appears to be an alternate timeline - Guyver Live Action Movies, Shawn Barker, an American college student, merged with the only bio-booster symbiote, also quite by accident. Like Sho Fukamachi, his counterpart, he came into conflict with his universe\u00b4s version of Chronos, and had to face a Zoalord.<\/p><p>He, too, interfaced with a Creator-ship.<\/p><p>In yet another alternate timeline - Guyver Animated Movie, Sho Fukamachi did become the first Guyver, but instead of Oswald Risker, a woman by the unlikely name of Valkuria became Guyver Two. Despite this difference, she met the same fate as her male counterpart. She was also a Chronos official.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : GUYVER<\/h2><p>It is not known if humanity was ever meant for mergence with the Boost Armor tool; though it appears a test millions of years ago provided unexpected results. The resulting Human\/Boost Armor combination was so different, so drastic, that the creators labeled the combination 'Guyba', translated from their language to mean \"Beyond the Norm\". The word 'Guyba' has currently been blurred into 'Guyver'.<\/p><p>The Boost Armor is a tool, not a weapon. A 'Guyba' however, appears to hold incredible destructive capabilities. It is because of the inherent characteristics of humanity that the Boost Armor's augmentation of a Human user yields such a powerful destructive force.<\/p><p>The Boost Armor affects each species, and each host differently. All data regarding the Boost Armor system is based on human booster specimens; and therefore must be noted as Guyba specific. Any data regarding the emergence of a Booster to another species is purely speculation.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : GRAVITY CONTROLLER<\/h2><p>The Gravity Controller is a metallic orb that is generated by the organic booster material. It's importance to the Boost Armor system is second only to the host and Control Metal.<\/p><p>The primary function is to siphon energy from the alternate spacial plane (dimension), which we believe is distributed as a gravitational field throughout the body, and to various Boost Armor organs. The gravity controller is essential for the summoning of the Boost Armor by a user, as it provides contact across the dimensional barrier. Hence, the gravity controller is responsible for:<\/p><ul><li><p>-Control of Gravitational Forces<\/p><\/li><li><p>-Providing the Energy for the Boost Armor to feed<\/p><\/li><li><p>-Providing the Gravitational Energy for a variety of Tools\/Weapons<\/p><\/li><li><p>-Dimensional Crossing<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>As a side note, the existence of the gravity controller greatly expands our view over the fabric\/structure of space... as we can see how gravity is one of the most elemental forces, linking between planes of existence... linking between dimensions. Strong evidence that supports string theory.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : LIFE SUPPORT<\/h2><p>Upon mergence, a Human is genetically modified, primarily to allow compatibility with the Boost Armor. These modifications also increase the strength of the bone and musculature structures; although the enhancement has only been demonstrated in the boosted form, leading us to believe that energy provided by the gravity controller is necessary in order for the enhancements to function.<\/p><p>It is known that a Human 'Booster' is capable of retracting the Boost Armor, thus attaining a quasi-Human form. In 'Human' form, the Human's own internal organs are used; but upon 'Boosting', (Summoning the Boost Armor form), the Boost Armor provides organs that are superior in performance. To eliminate unnecessary action and prevent conflict between the sets, the Human internal organs are regressed during the boosted form into mere remnants. The only exception to the regression is the Human's nervous system.<\/p><p>It is also known that the Boost Armor builds\/grows itself with redundant systems, meaning two of each organ.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : TELEPATHY GROWTHS<\/h2><p>Aside from genetics, one of the modifications to all human Boosters are permanent telepathy growths located on each shoulder blade of the user itself. Connected to the user's central nervous system, the primary purpose of the growths is for the human form of the Booster to summon the Boost Armor across the spatial plane (see Summoning)<\/p><p>They can be used for telepathic communication between Boosters, but it appears that the user must be in the Boosted form to transmit.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : ARMOR HEART<\/h2><p>The primary heart of the Armor, (in cases that we know of), rests beneath the left mid section of the torso (just beneath the breast plate). Even though the pulse rate is the same as the host, this organ is regarded as being more powerful than the human host's natural heart because it is astronomically stronger, allowing it to handle a greater flow (a greater volume and motion) of blood.<\/p><p>Understandably, the blood is easily pumped to the outside portions of the Boost Armor. We believe the host has been modified so that blood can flow through connective strings into the nose or mouth, to the host's enhanced muscles and natural brain.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : ARMOR LUNGS<\/h2><p>The primary lungs of the Armor rest beneath the breast plates; the closest chest organs to the skin of the host. The secondary lung is a compact organ; placed at the surface of the armor, between the upper portion of the chest plates.<\/p><p>Air is obtain through the 'breather units'. These are geometric nozzle structures which act like vents when expelling waste materials. Currently, it is unknown why they are placed in the mouth region of every Booster.<\/p><p>Connecting the lungs to the breather units are two cords along the neck. These cords extract oxygen so that the lungs may process it into the blood. It is because of these cords that a Guyver can breathe in any oxygenated environment, typically atmospheric and aquatic.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : ARMOR EYES<\/h2><p>The eyes of the Armor usually rest over the eyes of the host. Their structure however appears quite different. Based on the evidence available, the eyes appear to be thin surfaces exposed only when in Boosted form. The entire surface is absorbent to light, essentially expanding the vision; because of this, we believe the images are processed\/translated before being fed to the users mind. They have also been observed glowing; we believe they are providing their own light source when necessary... a self contained sensory system as opposed to a humans.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : MEGASMASHER<\/h2><p>The primary weapon of the Guyba system, a particle cannon of incredible power.<\/p><p>This weapon is an organ that rests under the breast plate, just over the Boost Armor primary lung. This weapon must be exposed in order to function; hence the capability for the breast plates to 'open'. The breast plates can be opened manually by being pulled by the arms; however, it is thought that a backup system exists... muscles are attached to the lower portion of each plate, unfortunately, due to their angle they are not as efficient and endure some strain to perform this act.<\/p><p>The organ appears to be a transparent globulous structure; however, it attains a sphere state upon activation. The sphere state of the megasmasher organ compresses the primary lungs of the Boost Armor, forcing the secondary lungs to compensate. Once the sphere state of the organ has been attained, an energy build up occurs. This energy build up emits a strong glow.<\/p><p>The organ then releases the accumulated energy at it's target in a wide beam type fashion... a beam that completely encompasses the target. This energy release could be described as similar to the blast of an atomic wave; it appears to vaporize anything in it's path. Unfortunately, due to energy constraints, this weapon can not be used continuously.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : FREQUENCY SWORDS<\/h2><p>The secondary weapon of the Guyba system.<\/p><p>A small protrusion can be found at the elbows of most Guyba systems. This protrusion is capable of extending to the length of approximately one meter, forming a back swept sword. This sword system is designed to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing it to cut through virtually any material.<\/p><p>This weapon is an excellent example of the Boost Armor's adaptability to a variety of user's, as there appears to be a variety of frequency sword formations... ranging from duel back swept swords, to even forward facing swords that rest over the energy compressor.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : POWER AMPLIFIERS<\/h2><p>Essentially, these are gravity based momentum boosters. These organic organs are located at various places through out the Boost Armor, notably at the fore arms and calves of the legs.<\/p><p>The operation of these organs can best be explained by mentioning Einstein's famous equation, E=MC\u00b2; meaning that matter and energy are interchangeable. The gravity controller provides the energy for the Power Amplifier organs to increase the mass up to ten times of the normal body weight. This mass increase is not to be confused as matter generation, it is relativity... by coupling more energy onto an individual particle, it's mass is increased compared to a similar particle in a different energy field. This can be thought of as giving a small car the power of a semi.<\/p><p>This energy\/matter conversion is a controlled process, and is used to manipulate the momentum of the Boost Armor. With this system, the force of a punch or kick is highly increased.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : ENERGY COMPRESSORS<\/h2><p>These organs are used to focus and compress energy that is provided by the gravity controller. On the Guyba, they appear to be located on the back surface of each wrist.<\/p><p>This organ, and apparently with the use of the fingers, can focus and compress energy into a mini-black hole. This singularity is apparently not stable, but temporary; and rather useful as a 'pressure cannon' weapon. Upon formation, the singularity sucks material into itself, (compressing it under high pressure). The hands can then give the singularity direction by dipping into the event horizon, and pull\/throw it towards a target. Upon entering the surface of the target the singularity breaks down, releasing the pressurized material, blasting open the target.<\/p><p>It is thought the energy compressors may serve other purposes. Research into their alternate applications is still under way.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : GRAVITY GYRO<\/h2><p>These organs rest aside the gravity controller, on each hip of the Boost Armor. By manipulating the energy provided by the gravity controller, they allow the Booster to control it's position in space, in essence allowing the Booster to fly\/float.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : HEAD BEAM<\/h2><p>This small orb rests above the Control Metal of every Guyba system, and is thought to be made of green zoa-crystal. It's function... a high intensity laser. It is known that the host of the Boost Armor can mentally target opponents with this weapon. The control metal has been observed automatically using this weapon to defend itself.<\/p><p>Even though it can only be used for cutting or burning, the head beam has the advantage over the megasmasher of having no charge up time, as it instantly converts energy into it's beam. Unfortunately, it seems that as a high energy device, the head beam laser can not operate while the Booster is exhausted.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that behind the head beam, are two red orbs. The function of these orbs is currently unclear, but we speculate that they are red zoa-crystal, and aid in the function of the head beam.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : SENSOR ORB<\/h2><p>Two metallic orbs rest at the sides of the Guyba systems head. These sensor units are akin to radar devices, actively scanning objects beyond the visual spectrum, even through barriers.<\/p><p>Each orb is capable of acting independently, but we believe that by working in tandem, they can obtain a three dimensional scan of the environment. It has been noted in every Boost Armor, that each sensor orb rests on an organic 'track' that allows movement. We believe the purpose of the 'track movement' is to switch position of an orb in the event that one is blocking the scanning view of another... or rather, obtain a better parallel scanning angle. The parallel scanning angle can also be moved to focus on particular objects for a higher degree scan. Whatever the implementation of tracks, the Orbs appear to move in positions for a better scan.<\/p><h2>SUBJECT : SONIC OSCILLATOR<\/h2><p>Located in the mouth region of every Booster are two small metallic orbs. The function of the sonic oscillator's is apparently to generate all audio emissions. This tool can be used by the will of the host to reclaim the ability of verbal communication. As a weapon, the sonic oscillator's appear to be able to target materials in the air, such as missiles and the surface of other threat objects. Unfortunately, the destructive aspect of the Sonic Oscillator's requires the host to focus on the target material.<\/p><h2>Other Media<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89742\/1712132-wah2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712132\" data-ratio=\"1.8129770992366\" data-width=\"262\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 262px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:181.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89742\/1712132-wah2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712132\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\" data-width=\"262\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89742\/1712132-wah2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89742\/1712132-wah2.jpg 262w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89742\/1712132-wah2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89742\/1712132-wah2.jpg 262w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\" data-width=\"262\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Two low-budget films have been made loosely based on the Guyver.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-189587\/","id":189587,"name":"ARRIVAL!

The poster-boy for Lovecraftian horror, Cthulhu is the embodiment of fear and domination.","description":"<h2>Origin<\/h2><p>Cthulhu's origin is typically mysterious as it is a creature far older than the universe; it is one of the Great Old Ones, a collection of god like beings that roamed the multiverse far longer than we as humans could ever comprehend. Although it's gender is unknown (and is assuredly not one we can classify) it is generally referred to with a more masculine tone, if ever addressed in that context. Due to the limitations of human comprehension, Dread Cthulhu is given the title of omnipotence by our understanding of it; however, it is still but a high priest that worships beings that, by grand measure, transcend our concepts of omnipotence.<\/p><p>Cthulhu settled on earth and was imprisoned beneath the oceans in his sunken city of R'lyeh. The first appearance of the Cthulhu was in the short story \"The Call of Cthulhu\" published in Weird Tales in 1928.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Cthulhu was originally created by early horror author H.P. Lovecraft. The character has since been adapted to many other works but has always severed as an enormous presence in the world and a source of incomprehensible horror and power that is always a looming threat in the background that could destroy our world, our sun, and reality as we know it at whim. In all works, the fear the character derives, is not from its physicality or the god-like potency of its ability, but of it as a concept. Once a character discovers Cthulhu's existence, everything is thrown violently into perspective: humans are almost literally nothing compared to beings such as the Old Ones, we are to them even less than a virus is to us. If a human comes in contact with enough viruses, it can ultimately die; however, no matter how many of humans there are, we are still not even worth noting in the Eyes of the Old Ones- we might as well not even exist. Therefore, the protagonist's beliefs and faiths are shattered as they realizes human kind is simply an easily correctable mistake in a harsh, uncaring universe given no higher meaning than to be utterly dominated.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5869\/336097-75662-great-cthulhu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-336097\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1533333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5869\/336097-75662-great-cthulhu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-336097\"><img alt=\"Cthulhu Rises\" src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5869\/336097-75662-great-cthulhu.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5869\/336097-75662-great-cthulhu.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/a><figcaption>Cthulhu Rises<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Although it wasn't his favorite creation (that would be the colour out of space), Lovecraft was enormously proud of his character Cthulhu and universe and encouraged others to develop it and use his characters. This was most obvious in his works as editor and mentor to other authors and was said to often suggest total re-writes of horror tales around his own characters or in their universe.<\/p><p>August Derleth, one of Lovecraft collaborators, went on to further the mythos after Lovecraft's passing and would collect stories into anthologies further encouraging the use of Lovecraft's creation.<\/p><p>Cthulhu and the Cthulhu Mythos was championed by several famous authors in the 1980's, most notably Stephen King and Brian Lumley (<a href=\"\/necroscope\/4050-9351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9351\">Necroscope<\/a>), and interest in his works remained strong with many movies, comics, novels and other media dedicated to the myths. Metallica lyricist James Hetfield is famously inspired by Lovecraft using his works as basis or song lyrics and titles.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Morality<\/h2><p>Bluntly stated, applying a personality type to an Old God does not work, as they are driven by motives and plans that are much bigger than humans. Cthulhu is sometimes regarded as \"evil\", but this is not how it is depicted in \"The Call of Cthulhu\" and other works. Cthulhu is amoral, with an ethic that transcends conventional notions of good and evil. Cthulhu only seems evil to humans, as he has his own purposes which we don't know and cannot comprehend. He regards humanity as of trivial importance, that being just as a potential source of food and slaves (and not very useful slaves at that).<\/p><p>S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz describe this amorality as the \"anti-mythology\" of Lovecraft's fiction. In most mythologies, man's significance in the universe is validated by his connection to divine agents with similar moral values. However, Lovecraft shattered this conceit by basing his stories and mythos on the \"premise that common human laws and interests and emotions have no validity or significance in the vast cosmos-at-large... To achieve the essence of real externality, whether of space or time or dimension, one must forget that such things as organic life, good and evil, love and hate, and all such local attributes of a negligible and temporary race called mankind, have any existence at all... [W]hen we cross the line to the boundless and hideous unknown\u2014the shadow haunted <i>Outside<\/i>\u2014we must remember to leave our humanity and terrestrialism at the threshold.\" Throughout all works, Cthulhu's nature seems to be consistent with this view.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Ability<\/h2><p>It should be noted that although by human comprehension Cthulhu is both omnipotent and omniscient, he is not close to the top of the power hierarchy of Lovecraftian lore (he is dwarfed by beings such as Azathoth and Yog Sothoth), and therefore carries the title of \"High Priest\". Even though Cthulhu is hinted at being omnipotent, it rarely (if never) uses remote fractions of said power; it can be assumed that since Cthulhu is neigh-immortal in terms of both being eternal and 'un-killable', the being does not need to put forth any effort as no matter what happens it will eventually get what it wants. In addition, the \"type\" of immortality that Cthulhu has is beyond what most can comprehend, as he is said to outlast death itself. It should be noted that although many \"powers\" are listed, Cthulhu only has its physicality and psychic ability at it's disposal. However, Cthulhu's psychic ability is, by every definition of the word, limitless. This limitlessness combined with a knowledge of everything across the multiverse (including all spells) allows Cthulhu the ability to control every facet of reality at will with ease.<\/p><p>Arguably Cthulhu's most notable trait is the fact that he, alongside the rest of Great Old Ones, cannot be comprehended by humans; when a human so much as looks at a visage of Cthulhu, they will almost certainly be driven mad.<\/p><p>There is a misconception among many that a boat killed, or banished, Cthulhu. As amusing as that sounds, it is simply not the case. The boat, however, was able to temporarily harm Cthulhu since Cthulhu was left in a weakened state after briefly 'waking up' from its death-like hibernation. Further, the main reason that Cthulhu did not pursue the ship was that it was simply disinterested. It is cited that Cthulhu went back to sleep because the stars were not right; it wasn't time for him to awaken.<\/p><p>There is another misconception that Cthulhu it \"trapped\" in R'lyeh. It should be noted that this is not true, as evidence by it's emergence when Gustaf Johansen and his companions came close to R'lyeh, as Cthulhu came out to investigate their arrival with his own eyes, before going back to sleep. In any work, it is never said that Cthulhu is captive or imprisoned in his own sunken city. However, it is regarded in the work as a tomb, which might have brought about the misconception. R'lyeh is considered Cthulhu's tomb due to the death-like way Cthulhu \"sleeps\" whilst he dreams and waits.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Followers<\/h2><p>Cthulhu is said to have a world-wide 'doomsday cult' centered in Arabia. The Cult of Cthulhu has followers scattered across the entire world (as it is extremely effective at recruiting new members), and the cult itself has survived through the centuries. The cult's behind-the-scenes activities play a major role in both H.P.L and Derleth's stories, and through them Cthulhu can continue to implicitly exert his influence while it dreams in R'lyeh. The supposedly immortal leaders of Cthulhu's cult are said to reside in the secluded mountains of China. This cult is portrayed as nihilistic in nature and seeks to awaken the Old Ones and bring about an apocalyptic age of darkness in which, according to some stories, men would be reduced to screaming and ripping both themselves and each other apart in fits of madness. Though humans might worship Cthulhu as he lies sleeping, they are immaterial to his grand design. Cthulhu is also worshiped by the horrific Deep Ones and the Mi-go, other alien beings in Lovecraft's world.<\/p><p>Cthulhu also has numerous \"star-spawn\" at his disposal, as the star-spawn of Cthulhu (or <i>Cthulhi<\/i>) are beings who arrived on Earth with Cthulhu. Like Cthulhu, they can mutate their shapes, but always retain their master's distinctive outline albeit smaller. The nature of the \"star-spawn\" and their relationship with Cthulhu is not widely known. After coming to Earth, the star-spawn built a great basalt city called R'lyeh on an island in the Pacific Ocean. They warred briefly with the Elder Things (the creators of mankind), but thereafter established a treaty. When R'lyeh sank, most of the star-spawn became trapped beneath the sea with Cthulhu.<\/p><p>Cthulhu has several avatars, including B'moth (Beh'moth, the Devourer) and Chorazin.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Family Tree<\/h2><ul><li>Azathoth (great-great-grandfather)<\/li><li>Yog-Sothoth (grandfather)<\/li><li>Shub-Niggurath (grandmother)<\/li><li>Nug (parent)<\/li><li>Hnargu (brother)<\/li><li>Kthanid (brother)<\/li><li>Hastur (half-brother)<\/li><li>Cthaeghya (half-sister)<\/li><li>Idh-yaa (wife)<\/li><li>Ghatanothoa (offspring)<\/li><li>Ythogtha (offspring)<\/li><li>Zoth-Ommog (offspring)<\/li><li>Cthylla (offspring)<\/li><li>T'ith (offspring)<\/li><\/ul><p> <\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5869\/336094-64247-great-cthulhu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-336094\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.98360655737705\" data-width=\"305\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 305px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5869\/336094-64247-great-cthulhu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-336094\"><img alt=\"Cthulhu rising from R'lyeh\" src=\"http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5869\/336094-64247-great-cthulhu.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static7.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5869\/336094-64247-great-cthulhu.jpg 305w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-width=\"305\"><\/a><figcaption>Cthulhu rising from R'lyeh<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>He is a being of power unimaginable to mere mortals. The very sight of him drives mortals mad. On 2012, at the rise of the Gibbous moon, on the end of the Mayan Calendar, he will awaken from his slumber and teach man a new kind of fear. He will arise from the lost city R'lyeh in the furthest Reaches of the sea. His spawn are the foul deep ones, smaller versions of the great one and the people of the lost city of R'Yeh. A place with structures built with non-euclidean geometry, the very likes of which cannot be imagined by mere mortals, and to lay eyes on it is to be driven to the depths of Insanity. His cult is centered in Arabia, with members all over the world, from Greenland to Chile. The leaders of the cult hailing from China. Among the Great Old Ones his main rival is his half brother Hastur.<\/p><p>Cthulhu was born on the planet Vhoorl, located in the 23rd nebula. He traveled to the star Zoth where he spawned his offspring. Along with his children and the Star Spawn of Cthulhu, Cthulhu traveled to Saturn and then to Earth. They landed on a continent in the Pacific Ocean and built the city, R'lyeh. Cthulhu received resistance from the Elder Things who also lived on the planet. They waged war for the planet Earth until a truce was made. Cthulhu then went into a deep hibernation within R'lyeh. Humanity then evolved on Earth and Cthulhu communicated with several through dreams, resulting in the Cult of Cthulhu. Disaster then struck R'lyeh, sinking it into the ocean. R'lyeh has risen from the ocean for brief amounts of time. However, it is fated that R'lyeh will rise from the ocean permanently and Cthulhu will retake the world.<\/p><p>A famous phrase about Cthulhu is \"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn\" which roughly translates into \"In his house at R'lyeh Dead Cthulhu lies dreaming\". He inspired the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred to create the Nercronomicon, a book bound in human flesh, the pages made of skin, and the words written in blood, that describes many gory rituals to awaken the great old ones and describes them in horrific detail. Perhaps the most famous Couplet from it is \" That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange \u00e6ons even death may die\".<\/p><p>He has many minions, not the least of which are the horrific Deep ones. He has divine servants such as Dagon and Hydra, though it is debatable whether or not that they are Divine or simply just really large Deep ones. But his favored minions are The Star spawn of Cthulhu, also known as the Cthulhi, they are like Miniature versions of their great and dark Master. Cthulhu's Consort is Idh-yaa and she bore him four children. In order from oldest to youngest they are, Ghatanothoa, Ythogtha, Zoth-Ommog, and Cthylla. The first three being his sons, and the last being his only daughter. Cthylla is guarded by deep ones and far worse creatures as she is vital to the Great one's plans. For if somehow Cthulhu were to ever be destroyed beyond his healing factor's ability to repair, she would give birth to him again.<\/p><ul><li>He has power beyond mortal comprehension and is able to nearly instantly regenerate his body if it is ever to be damaged the wound will heal faster than it is made.<\/li><li>He is the ruiner of countless worlds, the devourer of innumerable souls (and suns), and ender of hope.<\/li><li>He also has immortality beyond what most can comprehend, for it is stated that he will outlast death itself. If this is true then he can never be truly destroyed.<\/li><li>He is as large if not larger than any earthly mountain, being able to stand well above sea level in some of the deepest parts of the sea.<\/li><li>It is unknown whether or not he can fly using his massive wings, but it is probable.<\/li><\/ul><p>He is also capable of shape shifting, as he has taken multiple forms over the years; however, the Octopus headed, Dragon winged, Human caricature is the most familiar. Some more obscure forms include a gigantic pulsing blob of writhing tentacles and mountainous pseudopod and a huge mass of constantly changing colors. All will cause a man to go insane upon glancing it.<\/p><p>In fact Cthulhu's power is so tremendous that when he is to awaken everything in 1,000 miles of R'lyeh will either be destroyed in mind, body, and soul which is the fate of the more fortunate ones, or go irrevocably insane as you see the truths of the omniverse. Unlike most beings who are limited to one multiverse, Cthulhu exists in the Dungeons and Dragons multiverse as well as the Lovecraft mythos at the same time. His mastery of magics, technology, and psionics have few equals anywhere in existence and the simple fact that he has mastered all three of these rather than just one is truly a feat. He also is capable of reality, matter, energy, time, and space manipulation on a truly massive scale. His age is stated to be in the vigintillions of years, or 120 zeroes. By this count, Cthulhu already has a lifespan that dwarfs our own universe's, as the universe is merely 13.772 billion years old and is predicted to last for only five billion more years (according to the theory of eternal inflation, which states that our universe is part of the multiverse); this therefore implies that he has seen many many universes come and go and that ours is merely the latest one to him.<\/p><p>More of his powers include: the ability to ignore nuclear weapons as if they were nothing, knowledge and mastery of every single spell, and much like the vast majority of the great old ones, is able to summon Azathoth (chiefest God with all immeasurable, even compared to Cthulhu). Azathoth is the ruler of the outer gods, beings above the Great old ones and equals of the Elder gods in the books of August Derleth.<\/p><p>Cthulhu's resources also are practically as endless as his power. He has an army of truly massive proportions at his disposal, consisting of untold legions of insane horrors all over the multiverses he exists in. R'lyeh was merely the tip of the iceberg of the resources at his disposal, so to speak. As mentioned he has mastered sciences mankind has never seen (or will never for that matter), and he has mastered magics well beyond the reach of any man, and his control over psionic forces has few peers, as it is truely limitless. His allies are many and his enemies are few. For who would in their right mind challenge something that is madness incarnate?<\/p><p>While he has only starred in one book of Lovecraft's stories and has been merely a minor monster in his books, other authors soon increased his powers, from a world threat, to a universal threat, to a multiversal threat, in a few decades. He has spawned perhaps the most spin offs and rip offs of any Fictional Entity in existence. Shuma Gorath, The Illithids, Aboleths, and Elder Evils of Dungeons and Dragons, The Nameless things of Tolkein, and Virtually every madenning thing of a near unknowable age. As he is now public domain, he is commonly put into modern works, such as the justice league cartoon in terror from the stars, which featured a toned down version called Icthulhu as the producer mistakenly thought Cthulhu was still under copyright, the grim adventures in Billy and Mandy, and is a major subject in Nox arcana's necronomicon album.<\/p><p>His impact is undeniable and exploded upon the expiration of the copyright, as writers could finally use him in their works. Hollywood has been slow to notice and only in 2005 did they create a true to the book movie of Cthulhu, but that was but a test of the sellibillity of a Lovecraft movie. In the next decade a new saga of Lovecraft book based movies will be released. The next movie is to be The Mountains of Madness, where Cthulhu is referenced as being a mass of pulpy tentacles on an amorphous blob.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Cthulhu in Pop-culture<\/h2><h4>TV shows and movies<\/h4><p>This being was parodied in <a href=\"\/darkwing-duck\/4050-33769\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33769\">Darkwing Duck<\/a> as a being known as <a href=\"\/duckthulhu\/4005-76945\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76945\">Duckthulhu<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118136\/2618726-south_park_season_14_mysterion_rises_2_300x225.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2618726\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118136\/2618726-south_park_season_14_mysterion_rises_2_300x225.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2618726\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118136\/2618726-south_park_season_14_mysterion_rises_2_300x225.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118136\/2618726-south_park_season_14_mysterion_rises_2_300x225.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118136\/2618726-south_park_season_14_mysterion_rises_2_300x225.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118136\/2618726-south_park_season_14_mysterion_rises_2_300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Cthulhu appeared in two episodes of South Park: \"Mysterion Rises\" and \"Coon vs. Coon and Friends.\" <a href=\"\/cartman\/4005-10155\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10155\">Eric Cartman<\/a>, while in costume as the Coon, befriends Cthulhu and convinces him to remake the world in his image.

It is suggested that the movie would have been far less popular if Brandon Lee lived, as a result of all the media attention.<\/p><h4>The Crow: City of Angels<\/h4><p><i>For Further Information<\/i>: <a href=\"\/the-crow-city-of-angels\/4025-362\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-362\">The Crow: City of Angels<\/a><\/p><p>Years after the events of the first movie, Sarah (now portrayed by Mia Kirshner) has moved to Los Angeles, and became a tattoo artist.

The series also gave Shelly a much larger role, and featured other Crow characters such as Skull Cowboy, and an episode loosely based on The Crow Dead Time, depicting Eric and Shelly as reincarnations of Joshua (renamed Blackfeather) and his wife from that graphic novel and Top Dollar and T-Bird's gang as reincarnations of the confederate soldiers who killed them. The series also expanded on Eric's past, revealing that he was an adopted Vietnam war orphan, and had a brother named Chris Draven. The series also offered the new concept of evil versions of a Crow called Snakes, the evil avatars' guides being Pythons rather then Crows. In the episode 'Birds of a Feather' the series introduced a female avatar of The Crow named Hannah Foster AKA Talon (loosely based on <a href=\"\/razor\/29-46494\/\" data-ref-id=\"29-46494\">Razor<\/a> from <a href=\"\/the-crow-razor-kill-the-pain\/49-19021\/\" data-ref-id=\"49-19021\">The Crow\/Razor<\/a>), who was brutally murdered along with her daughter by a paedophile. She later befriends Eric, and they both help each other. The series ended on a cliffhanger with Shelly jumping through a Crow shaped portal in the land of the dead at the close of it's final episode.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Novels<\/h3><p><b>The Crow: Shattered Lives &amp; Broken Dreams<\/b><\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026213\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026213-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_hc.gif\" data-ratio=\"1.4797507788162\" data-width=\"321\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 321px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026213-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_hc.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026213\"><img alt=\"The Crow: Shattered Lives &amp; Broken Dreams HC by Various Writers\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026213-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_hc.gif\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026213-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_hc.gif 321w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Crow: Shattered Lives &amp; Broken Dreams HC by Various Writers\" src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026213-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_hc.gif\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026213-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_hc.gif 321w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Crow: Shattered Lives &amp; Broken Dreams HC by Various Writers<\/figcaption><\/figure><br \/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026214\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026214-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_sc.gif\" data-ratio=\"1.5224358974359\" data-width=\"312\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 312px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026214-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_sc.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026214\"><img alt=\"The Crow: Shattered Lives &amp; Broken Dreams SC by Various Writers\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" data-width=\"312\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026214-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_sc.gif\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026214-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_sc.gif 312w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Crow: Shattered Lives &amp; Broken Dreams SC by Various Writers\" src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026214-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_sc.gif\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/67663\/2026214-the_crow___shattered_lives___broken_dreams_sc.gif 312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" data-width=\"312\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Crow: Shattered Lives &amp; Broken Dreams SC by Various Writers<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><td><blockquote><p><i>With this chilling collection of stories and poems, J.O'Barr-- the creator of The Crow-- and Ed Kramer host an ominous array of interpretations of the gothic phenomenon by acclaimed writers well acquainted with the dark side.
