He believed that the creation of such a character would hurt the comic and the story they were telling.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Nevertheless, Golden's objections were promptly ignored by Shooter and when Micronauts vol.1 #8 came out, readers were introduced to the original Captain Universe. Many were blown away by the concept, others were furious. For over 30 years, Captain Universe was a C-List character until Jonathan Hickman revived the concept (with an entirely new twist) in the latest volume of Avengers.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Micronauts<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1154999-spotlight_v2_11_31_ad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1154999\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4640625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1154999-spotlight_v2_11_31_ad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1154999\"><img alt=\"Captain Universe\" src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1154999-spotlight_v2_11_31_ad.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1154999-spotlight_v2_11_31_ad.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/57845\/1154999-spotlight_v2_11_31_ad.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/57845\/1154999-spotlight_v2_11_31_ad.jpg 655w, http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1154999-spotlight_v2_11_31_ad.jpg 437w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\" data-width=\"437\"><\/a><figcaption>Captain Universe<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly afterward came the day upon which Wayfinder summoned the Enigma Force's might and crushed the Haamin once and for all. But even though Wayfinder and his allies had succeeded in destroying their enemy, their victory was bittersweet; they learned that during Wayfinder's quest to find the Sword in the Star, the Haamin had rendered all the planets they sundered incapable of supporting life.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Wayfinder and his fellow Wanderers decided that instead of trying to rebuild what little they had left in a bleak future that only reminded everyone of death and destruction, they would build a new society on Earth in the distant past.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Using Wayfinder's ship, the Star-Seed, the Prince and his followers turned back the sands of time and constructed a grand metropolis in what would one day become Indus Valley\/Bahawalpur in the country of India. But their new life on Earth would not be a peaceful one. Wayfinder had already come into conflict with a powerful but young demonic being who would one day become known as <a href=\"\/mephisto\/4005-2635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\"> Mephisto<\/a>, and still there was yet another threat lurking just over the horizon.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While Mephisto was still a powerful being in his own right, he was little more than a pest in those days. The true threat to Wayfinder's people came in the form of the <a href=\"\/whirldemons\/4005-54493\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54493\">Whirldemons <\/a>and their king, <a href=\"\/chaos\/4005-80454\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80454\">Chaos<\/a>. The Whirldemons were demonic creatures who had complete and total control over the element of Wind. They saw Wayfinder and his people as intruders upon what they believed was rightfully theirs and, without any mercy, they attacked Wayfinder.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Unable to fight them off, Wayfinder once again called upon the Enigma Force for help. The Enigma Force answered his prayers and those of Wayfinder's people by transforming the former Prince of Ithaka into a being beyond all mortal comprehension. Wayfinder had become the first <a href=\"\/time-traveler\/4005-58826\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58826\">Time Traveler <\/a>and was given access to certain portions of the Enigma Force that no mortal body could contain without being burned alive from the inside out.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">By accessing these new powers, Wayfinder was able to banish the Whirldemons into a lifeless extradimensional void. However, with their new home completely decimated, Wayfinder's people began to despair. Then, Wayfinder realized what he had to do; by completely giving himself over to the Enigma Force, he could create a safe haven for his people, but it would be at the cost of his own life, a cost he decided to pay without hesitation. Thus did Wayfinder bring <a href=\"\/microverse\/4020-43832\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43832\"> the Microverse<\/a> into existence and opened an interdimensional bridge for his people to cross.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Wayfinder then vanished into the Enigma Force and, for the next several centuries, it remained dormant, until a tyrannical madman named <a href=\"\/baron-karza\/4005-31861\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31861\"> Baron Karza<\/a> crossed the barriers between the Microverse and the mainstream Marvel Universe, took over the body of a demented scientist named Prometheus and launched an all-out invasion upon Earth. Having seen that not even Wayfinder's descendant, <a href=\"\/arcturus-rann\/4005-24681\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24681\"> Arcturus Rann<\/a>, would be able to stop Baron Karza in his current form, several Time Travelers came up with a scheme to drive Karza back into the Microverse. The scheme involved transforming a retired U.S. astronaut named <a href=\"\/ray-coffin\/4005-28038\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28038\"> Ray Coffin<\/a> (who had become trapped in the Microverse after falling into a dimensional gateway called the Prometheus Pit) into a being capable of overwhelming Karza.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Of course, the transformation took time, during which all hope seemed lost. By merely swatting the two heroes like flies, Karza had left Arcturus Rann helpless and <a href=\"\/marionette\/4005-24682\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24682\">Princess Marionette<\/a>, the woman whom Arcturus had fallen deeply in love with, hurt and unconscious. Then, just as Karza reached down to crush them, a superhuman surrounded by a blinding light emerged from the Prometheus Pit and engaged Karza in battle.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Captain Universe, the Avenging Angel and Avatar of the Enigma Force had arrived as their savior. It was not long before Captain Universe overwhelmed Karza and forced the tyrant to separate himself from Professor Prometheus and return to the Microverse defeated. With Karza gone and the threat to Earth now ended, the Enigma Force took back the powers it had given to Ray Coffin and decided to form a new sentient being called the Uni-Power, which would now travel across the Cosmos and would empower pure-hearted individuals during times of crisis so that they, as Captain Universe, could help avert the crisis at hand. Since then, there have been many Captain Universes, each of which having their own purpose to fulfill.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h3>Spider-Man as Captain Universe<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Spider-Man briefly became the host of the Uni-Power when a failed experiment on campus brought the Uni-Power to earth once again and entetred the body of Peter Parker. Although Spider-Man kept his original costume, the Captain Universe costume was sometimes visible as well.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Luckily, this power came in a time of need for Spider-Man, during the Acts of Vengeance, when many of the Marvel's super-villains traded their most common enemy for all new superheroes whom did not know how they operated.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This caused Spider-Man, empowered by the Uni-Power, to take on such menaces as <a href=\"\/graviton\/4005-13347\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13347\">Graviton<\/a>, <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk<\/a>, <a href=\"\/magneto\/4005-1441\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto <\/a>and the <a href=\"\/tri-sentinel\/4005-28982\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28982\">Tri-Sentinel<\/a>, villains that Spider-Man could never have beaten without the Uni-Power. Eventually, the power left Spider-Man once more and roamed the universe.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h3>Uni-Power Event<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Uni-Power began to experience memory and power loss and traveled back to Earth in search of a willing human host. This is where it found Gabriel Vargas, who agreed to bond with the entity and travel into The Microverse in search of that which was causing these problems.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">But first, the Uni-Power needed to process, replicate and download the powers of several super-humans in order to regain some stability. After bonding with the Hulk, Daredevil and X-23, it went to the <a href=\"\/fantastic-four\/4060-3804\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\"> Fantastic Four<\/a> for help. <a href=\"\/mr-fantastic\/4005-2151\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\"> Mr. Fantastic<\/a>, not one to refuse an opportunity to study The Uni-Power up close, agreed to help The Uni-Power discover the source behind its problems before they were attacked by Gladiator of the <a href=\"\/shiar-empire\/4020-23199\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23199\"> Shi'ar Empire<\/a>, who had orders to take him back to his superiors for imprisonment and study.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Uni-Power bonded with the Invisible Woman before Gladiator could get his hands on it and a battle ensued. During this time, The Invisible Woman had The Uni-Power bond with Gladiator to make him see the truth about the current dilemma it was facing.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Gladiator and The Uni-Power found out that Mr. Fantastic was incapable of repairing the problem, Gladiator offered to take The Uni-Power back to The Empire as a guest in the hopes that their scientists could do what Reed could not. The Uni-Power accepted Gladiator's offer and began their journey to the Shi'ar Throneworld of <a href=\"\/chandilar\/4020-55856\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55856\"> Chandilar<\/a>. However, as they were leaving Earth's Solar System, Gladiator and The Uni-Power were intercepted and captured by energy-consuming tyrant named <a href=\"\/krosakis\/4005-44347\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44347\">Krosakis<\/a>.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Krosakis used his vampiric-like energy siphoning abilities to force the Uni-Power to bond with him. This gained the attention of the Silver Surfer, who confronted and fought Krosakis and freed the Uni-Power from his control by overloading Krosakis with The Power Cosmic.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Uni-Power then bonded with the Silver Surfer, who infused The Uni-Power with a portion of his <a href=\"\/power-cosmic\/4015-41039\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41039\">Power Cosmic <\/a>and managed to repair its memory loss and power fluctuations. In addition to the repairs, bonding with The Power Cosmic put in place several protective barriers that would make it impossible for anyone to tamper with The Uni-Power ever again.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Silver Surfer then escorted The Uni-Power back to Earth, where it merged with a paraplegic Desert Storm veteran named Gabriel Vargas, whom The Uni-Power had made a bargain with following an incident that had resulted in the death of a police officer and severe injury to the Captain Universe (Ted Simmons) that had preceded Gabriel.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After getting used to the feeling of walking again for the first time in almost a decade, Gabriel, now in the guise of Captain Universe, parted ways with The Silver Surfer and began making his way into The Microverse.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h3>Annihilation: Conquest<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Two years later after the undocumented events of Gabriel's excursion into The Microverse, he resurfaced somewhere within the confines of <a href=\"\/kree\/4060-7588\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7588\"> The Kree Empire<\/a> or rather what was left of it following <a href=\"\/annihilation\/4045-41287\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41287\"> The First Annihilation War<\/a> and attacked a group of Kree Soldiers, whom he thought were slaughtering innocent people. After learning that these so-called innocent people were actually <a href=\"\/annihilation-wave\/4060-55905\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55905\"> Annihilation Wave<\/a> sympathizers, Gabriel allowed himself to be taken into custody, and was imprisoned alongside <a href=\"\/bug\/4005-5049\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5049\"> Bug<\/a>, <a href=\"\/deathcry\/4005-7231\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7231\"> Deathcry<\/a>, <a href=\"\/mantis\/4005-3324\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3324\"> Mantis<\/a>, <a href=\"\/rocket-raccoon\/4005-32814\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32814\"> Rocket Raccoon<\/a> and <a href=\"\/groot\/4005-24341\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24341\"> Groot<\/a> while awaiting trial. Following the initial conquest of both Kree and Annihilation Wave territories by <a href=\"\/ultron\/4005-2242\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\"> Ultron<\/a> and <a href=\"\/phalanx\/4005-9651\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9651\"> The Phalanx<\/a>, former <a href=\"\/lunatic-legion\/4060-55734\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55734\"> Lunatic Legion<\/a> leader <a href=\"\/galen-kor\/4005-19953\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19953\"> Galen Kor<\/a> was ordered by <a href=\"\/ronan\/4005-4818\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4818\"> Ronan the Accuser<\/a> to create a low-tech task force capable of successfully infiltrating and destroying a new version of The Phalanx Technophage Virus capable of spreading it further and faster than they would be able to via their standard methods.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Peter Quill, who had accidentally handed the keys to the kingdom, so to speak, to Ultron and The Phalanx when a group of infected Spacknights were allowed to upgrade the Kree Defense Network with a program called \"A-Ware\" was forced to take on the mantle of <a href=\"\/starlord\/4005-10957\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10957\"> Star-Lord<\/a> once more and was paired up with Gabriel and the others to create the task force Ronan desired.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Together, Gabriel and the rest of the \"Dirty Half-Dozen\" descended upon Hala without mercy and began viciously fighting their way through the heart of their newly conquered territories against Ultron's minions. In the process, several problems began to rise along the way, the first being the small feud between Gabriel and Deathcry, which continued to escalate until Deathcry went berserk and tried to kill Gabriel who, in self-defense, obliterated Deathcry using The Uni-Power.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gabriel was mentally traumatized by the event after realizing exactly what it was he had done and went into a shell-shocked state of being, which he remained in until he decided to stay behind and hold off an army of flesh-eating insect-like Phalanx drones while the others made their escape.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mantis, who had cloaked herself in order to keep from being captured by The Phalanx along with the others, sent a telepathic message to Gabriel, who managed to survive the Phalanx onslaught and told him that he was now their only hope for victory. After meeting back up and conversing with Mantis, Gabriel detached himself from The Uni-Power and sent it on a mission to infiltrate and hack The Phalanx Datacore possessing the cure to the new<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Phalanx Virus, which Star-Lord had discovered was airborne and inside the bodies of Hala's inhabitants. The Uni-Power complied and headed towards The Datacore, where it merged with one of The Phalanx Planner Drones and corrupted its programming. The Uni-Power allowed the drone it to think that it was in control of The Uni-Power and that upon accessing the Datacore it would be able to replicate The Uni-Power and create an army of Uni-Powered Phalanx drones, therefore making it the most favored Phalanx of all.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When its fellow Phalanx refused to allow the Uni-Powered Planner Drone to access the Datacore, it became angry and destroyed them all, thus allowing it to enter the Datacore unhindered.However, when this happened, The Uni-Power revealed its ruse and not only retrieved the data it sought but also obliterated the Datacore, thus destroying every bit of data they had collected in the short time since the Conquest of Hala. The Uni-Power then merged with Gabriel once more, allowing him to fend off The Phalanx while his teammates stole a getaway vessel. After returning to base, The Uni-Power shared the data it had collected with The Kree Science Divison and amicably parted ways with Gabriel.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h3>Something Can Stop The Juggernaut<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1170711\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.20625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1170711\"><img alt=\"Destiny Awaits\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-width=\"530\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg 795w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg 530w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Destiny Awaits\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg 1280w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg 795w, http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1170711-destiny.jpg 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-width=\"530\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Destiny Awaits<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A new Captain Universe surfaced in New York City hellbent on destroying <a href=\"\/juggernaut\/4005-1445\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\"> The Juggernaut<\/a>, who was found comatose in Central Park. A short time later, for whatever reason, Captain Universe placed a drunk driver and his car on top of the arch in Washington Square, which would later be discovered by <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man<\/a> while investigating The Juggernaut Incident.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After learning that The Juggernaut was still alive following their first incredible encounter, the new Captain Universe stormed the facility where his barely conscious target lay and found Spider-Man talking with The Juggernaut.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The new Captain Universe, who apparently seemed to recognize and address the web-spinner as if they were allies, demanded that Spider-Man stand aside so that he could finally finish what he started by slaying The Juggernaut, which Captain Universe claimed was his \"destiny\".<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Spider-Man attempted to distract Captain Universe, hoping that he could reason with the cosmic avatar but failed and, along with The Juggernaut's unconscious form, was tossed into The Jersey Palisades. Captain Universe quickly pursued his targets and found that The Juggernaut was still alive but not yet conscious. While trying to locate Spider-Man's current whereabouts, the wall-crawler pounced on his back, webbed his face up and tried steering him far away from The Juggernaut.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Captain Universe eventually shrugged Spider-Man off using a full-body energy burst and forced him to hitch a ride on a nearby news chopper and tried to call for back-up only to discover that he had forgot to charge his cellphone. Captain Universe quickly discovered where Spider-Man was hiding and came after him, but was once again webbed in the face, which provided Spider-Man with enough time to swing down into lower Manhattan. However, Spider-Man's escape was short lived as Captain Universe came up from behind the wall-crawler and hammered him through the wall of a private Athletics Club building. Spider-Man managed to outwit<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Captain Universe once more by throwing a towel on his face and made his escape. Thanks to information handed out to him by the frightened civilians at the club, Captain Universe was easily able to find out where Spider-Man was going. After arriving at the factory where Spider-Man was hiding, he found himself being covered in more webs.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Captain Universe reminded Spider-Man that his webbing was not capable of holding him, which Spider-Man acknowledged and said that he had wanted to slow Captain Universe down enough so that he could try to pound some sense into him.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">But before Spider-Man was able to get anywhere, Captain Universe sensed the eruption of several large tremors deep under the Earth's crust and, after hitting Spider-Man with a powerful psychic blast and wrapping a metal beam around his body to keep him in place so that he would be able to deal with him upon his return, went to check out the rapidly growing problem.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When he found that Earth's tectonic plates were coming undone Captain Universe began to question his true destiny, thus giving The Uni-Power itself a chance to speak and hopefully guide Captain Universe in the right direction. However, before Captain Universe could fully repair the shattered tectonic plates he sensed The Juggernaut's presence, shut out The Uni-Power's voice, erupted forth from underneath the Earth his adversaries stood upon and attempted to kill The Juggernaut once more.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Juggernaut attacked Captain Universe but was distracted by Spider-Man who said that Cain had to stop because the Captain was needed for something important. Cain didn't care. But before any more action could be taken Captain Universe turned the tables. With both of them in such close proximity, Captain Universe was able to pull Spider-Man and The Juggernaut into alternate dimension of his own making. They quickly found themselves trapped within another dimension of Captain Universe's own making.

Captain Universe revealed himself to be <a href=\"\/william-nguyen\/4005-70676\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70676\"> William Nguyen<\/a>, a former employee of a major financial firm that The Juggernaut tore through while attempting to outrun Spider-Man.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He explained that it was The Juggernaut's actions that had set into motion the chain of events which ruined his life. He had lost his job, his girlfriend, was forced to work menial jobs just to survive, was held up by muggers twice and ended up losing his apartment.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Thinking he had nothing to live for, Nguyen journeyed to a bridge tower overlooking the east river and prepared to commit suicide and end the hell his life had turned into.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">William continued onward with his tale and revealed that as he was looking down upon the east river, he began to have second thoughts. But before William could turn back, he slipped on the rain-soaked railing and fell to his apparent death. During the fall, though, William prayed for forgiveness and found those prayers answered by The Enigma Force, which imbued William with <a href=\"\/uni-power\/4015-44362\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44362\"> The Uni-Power<\/a> and transformed him into the Captain Universe that now held both him and Spider-Man prisoner.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">William recalled the events which led to The Juggernaut's unconscious body falling from the sky and crashing into the heart of Central Park. As it turned out, William had used his new-found powers to track down The Juggernaut. When he did, William blindsided The Juggernaut before he was even able to register what exactly was going on and carried him off into space. While attempting to probe The Juggernaut's mind for a weakness he destroyed his helmet. Thus leaving Cain open for a relentless Psi-Assault.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">William then elaborated on why he had placed the drunk driver and his car atop a monument in Washington Square and mentioned the events leading up to his explosive arrival at the Inwood Armory. He also mentioned the fractures beneath New York City and that, if The Enigma Force had not diverted his attention to them, he would have already finished Spider-Man off.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Juggernaut then cut in once more, stating that he did not care how much cosmic power William had at his command and that William would never even so much as dare face him in a real fight. Seeing it as a challenge, William brought Spider-Man and The Juggernaut back to Earth-616, where Spider-Man tried to calm both his former enemy and his newest adversary down and hopefully stop their fight before it could even begin. Just then, the fractures beneath the Earth began to unleash their rage, causing massive quakes and shock waves to rock the very foundations of Manhattan itself.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Spider-Man asked whether William had fixed the fractures or not, to which William replied no and declared that killing The Juggernaut was the only thing that mattered to him. This, of course, deeply offended The Enigma Force who stripped William of his power and transferred it over to The Juggernaut. With the powers of Captain Universe at his disposal, The Juggernaut delved deep into the Earth and located the fractures. Upon inspecting them, The Juggernaut realized that it was he who created the fractures during the course of his month-long journey through the underground following the first confrontation with Spider-Man he ever had. After taking a few moments to get the hang of using a \"gentle hand\", The Juggernaut healed the fractures and stopped the quakes.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He then returned to the surface where he took a hold of William and prepared to grind his whole body into dust. Spider-Man tried to talk The Juggernaut out of it, saying that he had just become a hero and saved all of New York from annihilation. When William realized that The Juggernaut was now the \"hero\" and saw that he had become the \"villain\", William gave into despair and told The Juggernaut to kill him seeing as William no longer had anything to live for. After several moments of silence, The Juggernaut dropped William to the ground and said that he was sorry for everything. The Enigma Force then commended The Juggernaut for his work and sent The Uni-Power on its way.<\/p><h3>Chaos Theory<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Chaos, King of the Whirldemons and Captain Universe's arch-nemesis, escaped from his extra-dimensional prison, The Enigma Force contacted X-23, Spider-Man and The Invisible Woman from \"somewhere else\" in time and space and revealed to the three heroes just how great a threat the Whildemons would pose to Earth should Chaos free them from imprisonment.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After revealing Chaos' origins, it sent Spider-Man and The Invisible Woman back to Earth-616 so it could chat privately with X-23, who taught her about how to live life and that all people were made of stars, which would later prove to be a useful bit of knowledge for her final showdown with Chaos.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When X-23 went to the prison where the Whirldemons and Chaos were trapped in, she transformed into Captain Universe and tore through The Whirldemons with ease. She then took her fight directly to Chaos and beat him, but instead of continuing to fight a battle that would last forever, she used the power of the stars to seal the dimensional void once again and returned to Earth-616.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Before parting ways, The Enigma Force appointed X-23 the new future heir to its mighty power, clearly suggesting that in the far-distant future she will become The Enigma Force just as Prince Wayfinder before her did.<\/p><h3>Deadpool vs. Thanos<\/h3><p>Deadpool was transformed into Captain Universe at the behest of Eternity in order to stop Thanos from using the power Mistress Death had given him to destroy all of actuality and managed to succeed in destroying Thanos, albeit temporarily, and saved the universe from destruction.<\/p><h3>Becoming an Avenger<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> After its encounter with Deadpool, the Uni-Power merged with a comatose woman named Tamara Devoux, who had been in a car crash with her daughter ten years ago, and answered the call to become an Avenger at the behest of Captain America and ventured to Mars where they faced off against Ex Nihilo, Aleph and Abyss. After recognizing Captain Universe as \"The Goddess\", Ex Nihlo and Abyss stopped their assault and submitted themselves to \"her\" will.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Aleph, a mechanical being designed purely for the purpose of destroying worlds, on the other hand had refused to acknowledge \"her\" claims and instead lashed out at \"her\" but it was for naught. With a simple touch, Captain Universe eradicated Aleph and restored order. After countless hours of study, the Avengers were unable to figure out why The Uni-Power was here let alone why it had taken Tamara on as its host, so they instructed Shang-Chi to try and coax Tamara out from deep within Captain Universe so they could get a better sense of what was going on.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Unfortunately, the meeting with Tamara didn't go as well as Shang-Chi hoped and she receded back into the recesses of Captain Universe's mind who revealed that it had chosen Tamara to be its host because she was broken and dying just as it was. When Shang-Chi and Captain Universe went to meet up with Iron Man, they found him diligently at work trying to decipher the language the new \"Adam\" or \"Blackveil\", a human created by Ex Nihilo, was speaking.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Captain Universe, who knew how to speak the unknown language, corrected Iron Man's erroneous translation of the language and revealed that \"Blackveil\" was actually the <a href=\"\/nightmask\/4005-14655\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14655\">Nightmask <\/a>of Earth-616 who, like all Nightmasks, heralded the coming of The White Event. But unlike other White Events, this one had been fired at Earth-616 just as the Superflow (a heavily monitored Multiverse-spanning network of weaponized stations that created White Events like the one that gave birth to the heroes of the <a href=\"\/new-universe\/4020-55729\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55729\">New Universe<\/a>) had completely collapsed and therefore did not include the proper data for choosing a Star Brand, Justice, Cipher, Spitfire, etc.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Instead, the \"Last White Event\" as Nightmask called it, had annihilated a college after imprinting the Star Brand on a young man who did not meet any of the requirements the White Events usually looked for in a Star Brand wielder. A young man who had been ignored his whole life and could be easily seduced by the overwhelming power of the Brand. Once the location of the Brand's landing had been found by Nightmask, Captain Universe accompanied him and the rest of the Avengers \"heaviest hitters\" to the site where they found the new Star Brand kneeling at the center of the carnage and chaos created by the Last White Event.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h2><b>The Captain Universes<\/b><\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/198971-148883-captain-universe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198971\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.345\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/198971-148883-captain-universe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198971\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" data-width=\"475\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/198971-148883-captain-universe.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/198971-148883-captain-universe.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/198971-148883-captain-universe.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/198971-148883-captain-universe.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" data-width=\"475\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is said that at all times on Earth there is a Captain Universe to help avert a crisis in the making.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A majority of these Uni-Power Wielders have never been seen before, though there are a few on record.

Later, when Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 came out, Captain Universe became one of The Hulk's alternate costumes as well.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the PS1 Spider-Man games, the Captain Universe uniform gave the player invulnerability and unlimited webbing, though like all of the other costumes in the game it had no impact on the story unlike the Captain Universe DLC for Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions. The Captain Universe DLC included not only four versions of the \"Cosmic Spider-Man\" uniform (three of which were new takes on the costume) but also added a new special ability for the four Spider-Men to use in-game while wearing their universe-specific version of the costume.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A small backstory explaining The Uni-Power's behind-the-scenes involvement with the game's story and small bits of trivia about Spider-Man's connection to Captain Universe also came as part of the whole package. Though the DLC was originally a pre-order bonus from Gamestop, it was later made available to the general public through the Playstation Store and the Xbox Live Marketplace. Captain Universe later returned as an alternate costume in the games Spider-Man: Edge of Time and Amazing Spider-Man. Captain Universe (Tamara Devoux) is also a playable character in the new Lego Avengers video game.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-19715\/","id":19715,"name":"Earth

They reportedly can grow more than five feet long and several feet thick, although there have been instances where they are shown to be able to grow to an immensely larger size. Burrowing in the ground, they tunnel about until a potential meal comes its way, at which point it will burst out of the earth. The rocky plateaus of the Gobi Desert are no trouble for the worms, as they tunnel through it as easily as they would dirt and sand. During the cold months of the winter, the worms lie dormant underground, while during the warmest months - especially June and July - they will hunt. The worms will frequently surface after it has rained, as wet ground makes for their prime hunting time.<\/p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3449146\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/3449146-mongolian_death_worm-the_monster_hunter%27s_survival_guide%232-acid.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.4558232931727\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/3449146-mongolian_death_worm-the_monster_hunter%27s_survival_guide%232-acid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3449146\"><img alt=\"Death Worm spitting acid.\" src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/3449146-mongolian_death_worm-the_monster_hunter%27s_survival_guide%232-acid.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15659\/3449146-mongolian_death_worm-the_monster_hunter%27s_survival_guide%232-acid.jpg 498w, http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15659\/3449146-mongolian_death_worm-the_monster_hunter%27s_survival_guide%232-acid.jpg 439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-width=\"439\"><\/a><figcaption>Death Worm spitting acid.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Mongolian Deathworm is a deceptively powerful being. Not only is it a dangerous ambush predator that can travel with great speed underground, but it can also kill from a distance by spitting acidic poison at its victims. This acid almost instantly corrodes whatever it touches, and is constantly secreted through its pores, making its very touch an almost certain and painful death. It can spit this acid over a distance of around six to eight feet, and can spit it from either end of its body, as both ends are essentially the same - it's usually quite difficult to tell just which end is its head. If that weren't enough, it also emits an electric shock that can kill, and is effective at a length of up to eight feet. Typically though it'll use this shock to incapacitate its victims in order to let its poison finish them off.

They kidnap some humans who seem to be involved in the catastrophe, but it has no effect.  They eventually determine that the Defenders are involved, and hold an inquest, inviting various friends and enemies of the Defenders to come and relate their knowledge of the team. This isn't enough, so they create a Time Buoy robot to spy on them.  This robot, known as <a href=\"\/luann-bloom\/4005-33033\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33033\">Luann Bloom<\/a>, malfunctions and starts to think it's human, so it has to be recalled by the Time Agents.  <br \/>They ultimately discover that the events are connected to the original Defenders, Dr. Strange, <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk<\/a>, <a href=\"\/namor\/4005-1476\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor<\/a> and <a href=\"\/silver-surfer\/4005-2502\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer,<\/a> acting together.

The alien empire does eventually find out about the crashed ship, and destroys the entire Earth in order to eliminate their bodies, in accordance with their customs.  The only way to stop this is for the original Defenders to break up.

Since the nature of this hoax isn't explained, it is unknown what exactly was true or untrue about the story.  Perhaps it was only the story of the alien ship that was untrue.  Perhaps the Tribunal or the Time Agents were not even who they said they were.  However, when the Tribunal first brought the Defenders to its time to talk with them, Strange looked at the Tribunal with the <a href=\"\/eye-of-agamotto\/4055-55701\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55701\">Eye of Agamotto<\/a>, and said that the Tribunal was in fact who it said it was (this is backed up by the fact that the Surfer said he had heard of the Tribunal before, and that even <a href=\"\/galactus\/4005-2149\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus<\/a> spoke of them in whispers).  This implies that perhaps only the story of the alien ship was false.  However, an Elf with a Gun has shown up in recent years, and showed no relation to the Time Agents or the Tribunal.  This implies that perhaps the Time Agents were not necessarily who the Tribunal said they were either, or at the very least that the Time Agents are not the same as the original Elf with a Gun.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>The Tribunal is a powerful cosmic entity.  They are omnipresent in time, but are unable to incarnate themselves in a particular past time period without causing great damage to that period.<\/p><p>They have great scientific knowledge, having created time travel technology, Time Buoy robots, and the Time Agents, who seem to be organic clones.<\/p><p>Some of their more minor shows of powers include putting someone to sleep, causing great pain in Namor, creating illusions, and telepathy.<\/p><p>They were also apparently capable of temporarily eliminating and then recreating powerful beings such as the Surfer and Dr. Strange without them being able to do anything about it.<\/p><p>Despite their great power, they are capable of error when they take on humanoid form.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-20659\/","id":20659,"name":"Inquest","issue_number":"87"},"gender":0,"id":27456,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/741208-tribunal1.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/741208-tribunal1.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/741208-tribunal1.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/741208-tribunal1.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/741208-tribunal1.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/741208-tribunal1.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/741208-tribunal1.jpg"},"name":"Tribunal","origin":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-7\/","id":7,"name":"God\/Eternal"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-31\/","id":31,"name":"Marvel"},"real_name":null,"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/tribunal\/4005-27456\/"},{"aliases":"Ying
