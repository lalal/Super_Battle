The molecular structure of the pickle was altered and enchanced. Overly developed muscle groups formed instantaneously. Gamma-enriched vinegar coursed through its veins. It became intelligent... noble... tasty. The pickle was code-named Weapon Kosher and began a strict training regimen under supervision of Dr. Formaldehyde. The pickle's superpowers were honed to sweet and sour perfection. Dill justice became its only desire.<\/p><p>It was decided that Weapon Kosher, and indeed all humanity, would benefit from a larger team of fresh and leafy heroes. Experiments were conducted on more foods, but alas, a backfire in the laboratory produced only rotten produce. Evil, rotten produce. The succes of Weapon Kosher could not be replicated.

She can also bring souls back, if not already in the possession of another (for instance, a god would have rightful ownership to a devout worshiper). In fact, the only souls out of the reach by death are those claimed by others, such as those who have contracted their souls to <a href=\"\/mephisto\/4005-2635\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto<\/a>.<\/p><p>There are also others who have a level of immunity to Death's \"gift\", such as immortals.

To spite her further, Thanos creates a companion for himself named <a href=\"\/terraxia\/4005-28004\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28004\">Terraxia<\/a> and tells Death he does not require her love any longer. This is just a plot for his love for her is undying.<\/p><p>Death eventually turns on Thanos and joins the cosmic beings in their attack on him. Thanos is deeply hurt by this.

She had chosen him for his ability to bring death to untold billions. She plagued his mind with dreams of the deaths he had caused. She tried to make him her consort by force, but her minions were no match for the Surfer. Seeking information, the Surfer sought an unlikely ally - Thanos. Thanos agreed to help the Surfer but was outraged that the Surfer would be chosen as consort instead of himself. Through trust, he captured the Surfer and took him to Death's realm.<\/p><p>Thanos made his last appeal to be by Death's side and offered the Surfer to her. She accepted, but Thanos wished to be her love in exchange for his gift. Once again he has shown Death that he does not wish to serve her but to barter with her. She refuses Thanos once again. Angry, Thanos frees the Surfer and they work together to defeat Death's minions. Before they escape, Death lets it be known that Thanos is forever barred from entering her realm ever again and he shall live forever.<\/p><h3>The Walker<\/h3><p>Lady Death was then met by a death god of another galaxy known as the <a href=\"\/walker\/4005-44380\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44380\">Walker<\/a>. He courted Death and she accepted him, much to the dismay of Thanos. As a gift to her, the Walker took the lives of all those in his galaxy into himself to offer to Lady Death. This gift disgusted her and she refused him, causing the Walker to become extremely angry. He decided that he would kill her for what she had done.

After they successfully slowed the Walker down, Thanos and the others led him to Purgatory, where none could die including Death.<\/p><p>Walker saw through Marlo and realized the truth of where Death was hidden.

But this backfired on Walker. Death would have given her life to end the suffering but being in a human host changed her traits to those more human, and far less forgiving. Death attacked Walker and removed the billions of souls from him, causing him immense pain and an eternity of agony.<\/p><p>Death returned Marlo to life, but as a result of Walker's torture, Rick Jones remained in an aged state and lost one of his arms.<\/p><h3>Annihilation<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25835\/575556-t_07_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-575556\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.492125984252\" data-width=\"254\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 254px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25835\/575556-t_07_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-575556\"><img alt=\"Mistress Death in the guise of a young girl\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" data-width=\"254\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25835\/575556-t_07_20.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25835\/575556-t_07_20.jpg 254w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mistress Death in the guise of a young girl\" src=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25835\/575556-t_07_20.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25835\/575556-t_07_20.jpg 254w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" data-width=\"254\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Mistress Death in the guise of a young girl<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When Thanos went on a pilgrimage to the <a href=\"\/the-kyln\/4020-56324\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56324\">Kyln<\/a>, a prison on the edge of the universe known as the Crunch, Death appeared before him as a human girl.

He is one of the few - if not the only - sane mortals that can see and interact with her. During his torture after his failure in Department K, she would often distract him with fantasy worlds for the two, such as dancing together or having a picnic. She was the reason he wanted to die during that time, so he could be with her. However, when Deadpool activated his healing power through his need for vengeance, he could no longer see or hear her which upset the plans she had for him. While they had a flirtatious relationship, she made it clear that they would never so much as kiss until after he died.<\/p><p>Thanos, jealous of her attention and affections toward Deadpool, makes sure they can never be together. In his efforts to keep them apart, he gives Deadpool's worst enemy, <a href=\"\/t-ray\/4005-19994\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19994\">T-Ray<\/a>, the power to bring Deadpool back to life after he was killed by Weapon X. Thanos also gives T-Ray a cosmic item, the Gemini Star, which would split Deadpool's personalities apart from him, leaving him nothing but a boring shell, unappealing to Death. Even though the plan failed, Thanos cursed Deadpool with a worse fate than death; with life, preventing Deadpool from ever enjoying Death's embrace.<\/p><h3>Thanos Imperative and Chaos War<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1511136\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5856079404467\" data-width=\"1209\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1209px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.6%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1511136\"><img alt=\"Death Gets Revenge on Lord Mar-Vell\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" data-width=\"403\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg 1209w, http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg 403w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death Gets Revenge on Lord Mar-Vell\" src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg 1209w, http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57845\/1511136-rescan004.jpg 403w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" data-width=\"403\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Death Gets Revenge on Lord Mar-Vell<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After the invasion of <a href=\"\/captain-marvel\/4005-1472\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Lord Mar-Vell<\/a> and his deathless minions of the <a href=\"\/the-cancerverse\/4020-56640\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56640\">Cancerverse<\/a> during the <a href=\"\/the-thanos-imperative\/4045-56101\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56101\">Thanos Imperative<\/a>, Death appears when Thanos is to be sacrificed by Mar-Vell.
