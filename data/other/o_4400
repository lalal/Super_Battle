Initially called Robotman in Japan, he was renamed Biotron when Mego bought the rights to produce the Microman toy line in the United States in 1976. Writer Bill Mantlo fleshed out a back story and a personality for Biotron during his initial run on Marvel's Micronauts series. Artist Michael Golden drastically scaled the character down in size but generally remained faithful to the original toy design. In Micronauts issue #26 Biotron was destroyed during a battle with Baron Karza and Hydra. Much later, all of Biotron's memories were downloaded into a giant spaceship, modeled off of Biotron's original appearance, called The Bioship. In Micronauts issue #58 Biotron was again restructured as a slightly larger than man sized roboid until he was again destroyed in Micronauts The New Voyages #4. Biotron was rebuilt yet again in Micronauts The New Voyages #9 and series artist Kelley Jones took the opportunity to give him a sleeker more streamlined redesign that had little resemblance to the original toy.<\/p><h3>Comics Origin<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/99019\/3895391-biotron2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3895391\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.8313253012048\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:183.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/99019\/3895391-biotron2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3895391\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/99019\/3895391-biotron2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/99019\/3895391-biotron2.jpg 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px\" data-width=\"166\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Biotron was created by the Homeworld engineers to serve as the eyes and ears for Commander Arcturus Rann during his long hypersleep.

These has often been speculation about the characters in story origins, with possible origins being explored in an alternative reality however nothing is as concrete in the mainstream reality concerning the Celestials true origins. \u00a0\u00a0<br \/><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>The Fourth Host<\/h3>During the 4th host, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\" href=\"\/odin\/4005-3507\/\">Odin<\/a> had infused his life force and all of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\" href=\"\/asgardian-gods\/4060-41205\/\">Asgard's<\/a> save for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\" href=\"\/thor\/4005-2268\/\">Thor,<\/a> into the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7940\" href=\"\/destroyer\/4005-7940\/\">Destroyer<\/a> armor to do battle with the Celestials in an attempt to save Earth from the final judgment of Arishem. Nezarr was the first to taste the Destroyers power, Destroyer slicing off the Celestials arm with the Oversword of Asgard also known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55890\" href=\"\/odinsword\/4055-55890\/\">Odin Sword.<\/a> However losing a limb meant nothing to Nezarr, and moments later regenerated his arm as if he had never lost it to begin with, and followed this by unleashing a barrage his own, far more powerful energy upon the Destroyer, ultimately reducing it to molten ruin along with his fellow Celestials displaying just how powerful they truly are. Nezarr was also seen appearing to attend the birth of a Celestial in the Black Galaxy which had in fact, been a Celestial experiment all along, with the Galaxy comprising the infant Celestials brain.\u00a0\u00a0<br \/><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2>Nezarr the Calculator like many of the Celestials is an extremely powerful god like being, possessing incalculable levels of strength, durability, speed and energy projection. Enormous in stature, up to 2000 feet in height, he possesses the ability to manipulate reality control energy and rearrange matter. They can teleport themselves or vast objects across vast distances. Although near invulnerable, in the rare case of being injured or harmed, the Calculator will regenerate near instantaneously, as for instance when Odin was empowering the Asgardian Destroyer and wielding the Odinsword, and severed the Calculator's arm limb, only to have it reform moments later. Supposedly Celestials are impossible to destroy completely, and as such easier to imprison. Capable of withstanding earth shattering blows, and easily dismiss nuclear bombs, the Calculator also possesses the ability to generate energy blasts that are of an earth shattering level and higher. The Calculator can project illusions into other creatures brains. There is an unknown connection between the Celestials and Hyperspace. It is possible that Hyperspace is the origin of the Celestials vast powers. Nezarr the Calculator is the\u00a0mathematician of the Celestials.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/><b>Physical Characteristics<\/b>\u00a0<br \/>Height:\u00a02000' 0\"\u00a0<br \/>Weight: Varies\u00a0<br
